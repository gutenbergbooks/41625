<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In the early part of the winter of 1863&ndash;4, having the free use of
the Congressional Library at Washington, I began the compilation
of the present work. It was my prime intent, and one which
I have endeavored to follow most carefully, to attach some fact,
whatever might be its nature, to as many Insects as possible, to
increase the interest, in a commonplace way, of the science of
Entomology. I noticed the pleasurable satisfaction I invariably
felt when I came accidentally upon any extra-scientific fact, and
how the association fixed the particular Insect, to which it related,
ineffaceably upon my memory. To collect and group, then, all
these facts together, to remember many Insects as easily as one,&mdash;was
a natural thought; and as this had never been done, but to
a very limited extent, I undertook it myself.</p>

<p>The facts contained in this volume are supposed to be purely
historical, or rather not to belong to the natural history of Insects,
namely, their anatomy, habits, classification, etc. They have been
collected mostly from Chronicles, Histories, Books of Travels, and
such like works, which, at first view, seem to be totally foreign to
Insects: and were only discovered by examination of the indexes
and tables of contents.</p>

<p>But are my facts <em>facts?</em>&mdash;it may be asked. They are; but I do
not vouch for each one’s containing more than one truth. It is a
fact, or truth if you will, that Pliny, Nat. Hist. xi. 34, says,
“Folke use to hang Beetles about the neck of young babes, as
present remedies against many maladies;” but that this statement
is entitled to credit, and that these Insects, hung about the necks
of young babes, <em>are</em> a present remedy against many maladies, are
two things which may be very true or far otherwise. I confine
myself to the fact that Pliny says so, and only wish to be understood
in that sense, unless when otherwise stated.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_vi" title="vi"></a><!--007.png-->

<p>The classification of Mr. Westwood, in the arrangement of the
orders and families, I have followed as closely as was possible,
except in one or two instances: and where Insects have common
and familiar names, they have been given together with their
scientific ones.</p>

<p>To Dr. J.&nbsp;M. Toner, of Washington, for his suggestions and
assistance in collecting material, I tender my thanks; the same
also to N. Bushnell, Esq., and Hon. O.&nbsp;H. Browning, of Quincy,
Ill., for the use of their several libraries.</p>

<p>I am much indebted, too, to Mrs. A.&nbsp;L. Ruter Dufour, of
Washington, for many superstitions and two pieces of poetry
contained in this volume. I beg her to accept my thanks.</p>

<p>The Lady-bird in Europe, and particularly in Germany,

of the superstitions connected with it are supposed to have
originated, is always connected with fine weather. At
Vienna, the children throw it into the air, <span class="no-wrap">crying,&mdash;</span></p>

</div>

<p>In England, the children are wont to be afraid of injuring
the Lady-bird lest it should rain.</p>

<p>With the Northmen the Lady-bird&mdash;Our Lady’s Key-maid&mdash;is
believed to foretell to the husbandman whether the
year shall be a plentiful one or the contrary: if its spots
exceed seven, bread-corn will be dear; if they are fewer
than seven, there will be an abundant harvest, and low
prices.<a id="Marker_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="marker">8</a> And, in the following rhyme from Ploen, this insect
is invoked to bring food:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Marspäert (Markpäert) fleeg in Himmel!</div>
<div class="line">Bring my’n Sack voll Kringeln, my een, dy een,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>In the north of Europe it is thought lucky when a young
girl in the country sees the Lady-bird in the spring; she<a class="pagenum" id="Page_19" title="19"></a><!--020.png-->
then lets it creep about her hand, and says: “She measures
me for wedding gloves.” And when it spreads its little
wings and flies away, she is particular to notice the direction
it takes, for thence her sweetheart shall one day come.<a id="Marker_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="marker">10</a>
The latter part of this notion obtains in England; and it
has been embodied by Gay in one of his Pastorals, as follows:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">This Lady-fly I take from off the grass,</div>
<div class="line">Whose spotted back might scarlet red surpass.</div>
<div class="line">Fly, Lady-bird, north, south, or east or west,</div>
<div class="line">Fly where the man is found that I love best.</div>
<div class="line">He leaves my hand, see to the west he’s flown,</div>
<div class="line">To call my true-love from the faithless town.<a id="Marker_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="marker">11</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Norfolk, too, where this insect is called the Bishop
Barnabee, the young girls have the following rhyme, which
they continue to recite to it placed upon the palm of the
hand, till it takes wing and flies away:<a id="Marker_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="marker">12</a></p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Bishop, Bishop Barnabee,</div>
<div class="line">Tell me when my wedding be:</div>
<div class="line">If it be to-morrow day,</div>
<div class="line">Take your wings and fly away!</div>
<div class="line">Fly to the east, fly to the west,</div>
<div class="line">Fly to him that I love best.<a id="Marker_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="marker">13</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Why the Lady-bird is called Bishop Barnabee, or Burnabee,
there is great difference of opinion. Some take it to
be from St. Barnabas, whose festival falls in the month of
June, when this insect first appears; and others deem it
but a corruption of the Bishop-that-burneth, in allusion to
its fiery color.<a id="Marker_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="marker">14</a></p>

<p>The following metrical jargon is repeated by the children
in Scotland to this insect under the name of Lady Lanners,
or Landers:<a id="Marker_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="marker">15</a></p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Lady, Lady Lanners,</div>
<div class="line">Lady, Lady Lanners,</div>
<div class="line">Tak’ up your clowk about your head,</div>

<div class="line">Flee ower firth, and flee ower fell,</div>
<div class="line">Flee ower pule and rinnan’ well,</div>
<div class="line">Flee ower muir, and flee ower mead,</div>

<div class="line">Flee ye east, or flee ye west,</div>
<div class="line">Flee till him that lo’es me best.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So it seems that also in Scotland, the Lady-bird, which
is still a great favorite with the Scottish peasantry, has
been used for divining one’s future helpmate. This likewise
appears from a rhyme from the north of Scotland, which
dignifies the insect with the title of Dr. Ellison:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Dr. Dr. Ellison, where will I be married?</div>
<div class="line">East, or west, or south, or north?</div>
<div class="line">Take ye flight and fly away.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is sometimes also termed Lady Ellison, or knighted
Sir Ellison; while other Scottish names of it are Mearns,
Aberd, The King, and King Galowa, or Calowa. Under
this last title of dignity there is another Scottish rhyme,
which evinces also the general use of this insect for the
purpose of divination:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">King, King Calowa,</div>
<div class="line">Up your wings and flee awa’</div>
<div class="line">Over land, and over sea;</div>
<div class="line">Tell me where my love can be.<a id="Marker_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="marker">16</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is a Netherlandish tradition that to see Lady-birds
forebodes good luck;<a id="Marker_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="marker">17</a> and in England it is held extremely
unlucky to destroy these insects. Persons killing them, it
is thought, will infallibly, within the course of the year,
break a bone, or meet with some other dreadful misfortune.<a id="Marker_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="marker">18</a></p>

<p>In England, the children are accustomed to throw the
Lady-bird into the air, singing at the same <span class="no-wrap">time,&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home;</div>
<div class="line">Your house is on fire, your children’s at home,</div>

<div class="line">Ply thee home, lady-bird, ere it be gone.<a id="Marker_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="marker">19</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_21" title="21"></a><!--022.png-->

<p>Or, as in Yorkshire and <span class="no-wrap">Lancashire,&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Lady-bird, lady-bird, eigh thy way home;</div>
<div class="line">Thy house is on fire, thy children all roam,</div>
<div class="line">Except little Nan, who sits in her pan,</div>
<div class="line">Weaving gold laces as fast as she can.<a id="Marker_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="marker">20</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or, as most commonly with us in <span class="no-wrap">America,&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home,</div>
<div class="line">Your house is on fire, and your children all burn.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The meaning of this familiar, though very curious couplet,
seems to be this: the larvæ, or young, of the Lady-bird
feed principally upon the aphides, or plant-lice, of the vines
of the hop; and fire is the usual means employed in destroying
the aphides; so that in killing the latter, the former,
which had come for the same purpose, are likewise destroyed.</p>

<p>Immense swarms of Lady-birds are sometimes observed
in England, especially on the southeastern coast. They
have been described as extending in dense masses for miles,
and consisting of several species intermixed.<a id="Marker_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="marker">21</a> In 1807,
these flights in Kent and Sussex caused no small alarm to
the superstitious, who thought them the forerunners of some
direful evil. They were, however, but emigrants from the
neighboring hop-grounds, where, in their larva state, they
had been feasting upon the aphides.<a id="Marker_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="marker">22</a></p>

<p>The Lady-bird was formerly considered an efficacious
remedy for the colic and measles;<a id="Marker_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="marker">23</a> and it has been recommended
often as a cure for the toothache: being said, when
one or two are mashed and put into the hollow tooth, to
immediately relieve the pain. Jaeger says he has tried
this application in two instances with success.<a id="Marker_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="marker">24</a></p>

<p>In the northern part of South America&mdash;the Spanish
Main&mdash;a species of Lady-bug, Captain Stuart tells me, is
extensively worn as jewels and ornaments. He may, however,
refer to some species of the Gold-beetles&mdash;<i>Chrysomelidæ</i>,
next mentioned.</p>

<p>Hurdis, who has frequently, in his Poems, availed himself
of the modern discoveries in Natural History, has
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_22" title="22"></a><!--023.png-->
drawn the following accurate and beautiful picture of the
Lady-bird in his tragedy of Sir Thomas More:</p>

<p>Southey, also, in his lines addressed to this insect under
the name of the Burnie-Bee, has thus elegantly described
it:</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_23" title="23"></a><!--024.png-->

</div>


<h3 id="Chrysomelidae_Gold-beetles">Chrysomelidæ&mdash;Gold-beetles.</h3>

<p>In Chili and Brazil, the ladies form necklaces of the
golden <i>Chrysomelidæ</i> and brilliant Diamond-beetles, with
which their countries abound, which are said to be very
beautiful.<a id="Marker_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="marker">27</a> The wing-cases of our common Gilded-Dandy,
<i>Eumolpus auratus</i>, the metallic colors of which are pre-eminently
brilliant and showy, have been recommended as
ornaments for fancy boxes, and such like articles.<a id="Marker_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="marker">28</a> A
closely allied species, I have seen upon the finest Parisian
artificial flowers.</p>


<h3 id="Carabidae">Carabidæ.</h3>

<p>In some parts of Africa, a rather curious benefit is derived
from a large beetle belonging to this family, the
<i>Chlænius saponarius</i>, for it is manufactured by the natives
into a soap.<a id="Marker_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="marker">29</a></p>


<h3 id="Pausidae">Pausidæ.</h3>

<p>The etymology of the word <i>Pausus</i>, Dr. Afzelius imagines
to be from the Greek παυσις, signifying a pause,
cessation, or rest; for Linnæus, now (in 1796) old and infirm,
and sinking under the weight of age and labor, saw
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_24" title="24"></a><!--025.png-->
no probability of continuing any longer his career of glory.
He might therefore be supposed to say <i>hic meta laborum</i>,
as it in reality proved, at least with regard to insects, for
Pausus was the last he ever described.<a id="Marker_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="marker">30</a></p>


<h3 id="Dermestidae_Leather-beetles">Dermestidæ&mdash;Leather-beetles.</h3>

<p>In one of the stone coffins exhumed from the tumuli in
the links of Skail, were found several small bags, which
seemed to have been made of rushes. They all contained
bones, with the exception of one, which is said to have been
full of beetles belonging to the genus <i>Dermestes</i>. Both the
bag and beetles were black and rotten.<a id="Marker_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="marker">31</a></p>

<p>Four species of <i>Dermestes</i> were found in the head of one
of the mummies brought by Sir J. Gardner Wilkinson from
Thebes&mdash;the <i>D. vulpinus</i> of Fabricius, and the <i>pollinctus</i>,
<i>roei</i>, and <i>elongatus</i> of Hope.<a id="Marker_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="marker">32</a></p>

<p>It is a remarkable coincidence that two peoples should
bury beetles of the same genus with their dead, and much
the more so, when they differ so widely, as did the ancient
Britons and Egyptians. Was it for the same reason&mdash;the
result of any communication?</p>

<p>At one time the ravages of the <i>Dermestes vulpinus</i> were
so great in the skin-warehouses of London, that a reward
of £20,000 was offered for an available remedy.<a id="Marker_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="marker">33</a></p>


<h3 id="Lucanidae_Stag-beetles">Lucanidæ&mdash;Stag-beetles.</h3>

<p>The etymology of the word Lucanus, as well as its application
to a species of insect, it is interesting to notice.
The ancients gave the name of <i>Lucas</i>, <i>Lucana</i>, to the <i>ox</i>
and elephant. It is said that Pyrrhus had thus named the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_25" title="25"></a><!--026.png-->
elephant the first time that he saw it, because this word
signified ox in his own language, and that he thus gave it
the name of the largest animal which he had ever before
seen. According to Pliny, who employed the word <i>Lucani</i>,
in speaking of the Horn-beetles, Nigridius was the first
who gave the name to these insects; and this he did, most
probably, from their large size, and the resemblance of their
mandibles to horns. Dalechamp, however, thinks that the
name <i>Lucanus</i> was given to the Horn-beetle only because
this insect was very common among the Lucanians, a
people of Italy. But it is probable, after what has been
above said, that the Lucanians themselves were thus named,
in consequence of the great numbers of oxen which they
reared. The common name, <i>Flying-bull</i>, given to this insect
in different languages, corresponds very well with that
given by Nigridius.<a id="Marker_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="marker">34</a></p>

<p>A popular belief in Germany is, that the Stag-beetle,
<i>Lucanus cervus</i>, carries burning coals into houses by
means of its jaws, and that it has thus occasioned many
fearful fires.<a id="Marker_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="marker">35</a></p>

<p>In the New Forest of England, the Stag-beetle by the
rustics is called the <i>Devil’s Imp</i>, and is believed to be sent
to do some evil to the corn; and woe be to this unfortunate
insect when met by these superstitious foresters, for it is
immediately stoned to death. A writer, in the Notes and
Queries,<a id="Marker_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="marker">36</a> states that he saw one of these insects actually
thus destroyed.</p>

<p>Professor Bradley, of Cambridge, mentions the following
remarkable instance of insect strength in a Stag-beetle.
He asserts that he saw the beetle carry a wand a foot and
a half long, and half an inch thick, and even fly with it to
the distance of several yards.<a id="Marker_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="marker">37</a> Linnæus observes, that if
the elephant was as strong in proportion as the Stag-beetle,
it would be able to tear up rocks and level mountains.<a id="Marker_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="marker">38</a></p>

<p>Bingley has the following marvelous story of the supposed
rapacity of the Stag-beetle, which, it has been remarked,
if not gravely stated by the reverend editor of the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_26" title="26"></a><!--027.png-->
Animal Biography, as related to him by one of his own
intimate and intelligent friends, might have been supposed
by the general reader to have been borrowed from the
Travels of the veracious Munchausen. “An intimate and
intelligent friend of the editor informed him that he had
often found several heads of these insects together, all perfectly
alive, while the abdomens were gone, and the trunks
and heads were left together. How this circumstance took
place he never could discover with any certainty. He supposes,
however, that it must have been in consequence of
the severe battles that sometimes take place among the
fiercest of the insect tribes; but their mouths not seeming
formed for animal food, he is at a loss to guess what becomes
of their abdomens. They do not fly till most of the
birds have retired to rest, and indeed if we were to suppose
that any of them devoured them, it would be difficult to
say why the heads or trunks should be rejected.”<a id="Marker_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="marker">39</a></p>

<p>Moufet says: “When the head (of the Stag-beetle) is
cut off, the other parts of the body live long, but the head
(contrary to the usual custom of insects) lives longer. This
is said to be dedicated to the moon, and the head and horns
of it wax with the moon, and do wane with the moon, but it
is the opinion of vain astrologers.”<a id="Marker_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="marker">40</a></p>

<p>The mandibles of the Stag-beetle were formerly employed
in medicine, under the name of Horns of Scarabæi. This
remedy was administered as an absorbent, in case of pains
or convulsions supposed to be produced by acidity in the
<i>primæ viæ</i>.<a id="Marker_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="marker">41</a> This is the insect most probably alluded to
by Pliny, when he says, “Folke use to hang Beetles about
the neck of young babes, as present remedies against many
maladies.”<a id="Marker_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="marker">42</a> The <i>Scarabæus cornutus</i> of Schröder (v. 345)
is also, perhaps, the <i>Lucanus cervus</i>. We learn from this
gentleman that it has been recommended to be worn as an
amulet for an ague, or pains and contractions of the tendons,
if applied to the part affected. He tells us also, that
if tied about the necks of children, it enables them to retain
their urine. An oil, prepared by infusion of these insects,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_27" title="27"></a><!--028.png-->
is recommended by the same author, in pains of the ears, if
dropped into them.<a id="Marker_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="marker">43</a></p>

<p>The <i>Cossus</i> of the Greeks and Romans, which, at the
time of the greatest luxury among the latter, was introduced
at the tables of the rich, was the larva, or grub, of a
large beetle that lives in the stems of trees, particularly the
oak; and was, most probably, the larva of the Stag-beetle,
<i>Lucanus cervus</i>. On this subject, however, entomologists
differ very widely, for it has been supposed the larva of the
<i>Calandra palmarum</i> by Geoffroy and Keferotein; of the
<i>Prionus damicornis</i> by Drury; but of the <i>Lucanus cervus</i>
by Roesel, Scopoli, and most others. The first two, being
neither natives of Italy nor inhabiting the oak, are out of
the question. But the larva of the <i>Lucanus cervus</i>, and
perhaps also the <i>Prionus coriarius</i>, which are found in the
oak as well as in other trees, may each have been eaten under
this name, as their difference could not be discernible
either to collectors or cooks. Linnæus, following the
opinion of Ray, supposed the caterpillar of the great Goat-moth
to be the cossus.<a id="Marker_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="marker">44</a></p>

<p>Pliny tells us that the epicures, who looked upon these
<i>cossi</i> as delicacies, even fed them with meal, in order to
fatten them.<a id="Marker_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="marker">45</a></p>

<p>Our children, who call the Stag-beetles and the <i>Passalus
cornutus</i>, oxen, are wont to hitch them with threads to
chips and small sticks, and, for their amusement, make them
drag the wood along as if they were oxen.</p>


<h3 id="Scarabaeidae_Dung-beetles">Scarabæidæ&mdash;Dung-beetles.</h3>

<p>The <i>Coprion</i>, <i>Cantharus</i>, and <i>Heliocantharus</i> of the ancients
were evidently the <i>Scarabæus (Ateuchus) pilurarius</i>,
or, as it is commonly called, the Tumble-dung, or one nearly
related to it, for it is described as rolling backward large
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_28" title="28"></a><!--029.png-->
masses of dung; and in doing this it attracted such general
attention as to give rise to the proverb <i>Cantharus pipulam</i>.
From the name, derived from a word signifying an ass, it
should seem the Grecian beetle made, or was supposed to
make, its pills of <i>asses’</i> dung; and this is confirmed by a
passage in one of the plays of Aristophanes, the Irene,
where a beetle of this kind is introduced, on which one of
the characters rides to heaven to petition Jupiter for peace.
The play begins with one domestic desiring another to feed
the Cantharus with some bread, and afterward orders his
companion to give him another kind of bread made of <i>asses’</i>
dung.<a id="Marker_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="marker">46</a></p>

<p>Illustrative of the great strength of the Tumble-bug, the
following anecdote may be related: Dr. Brichell was supping
one evening in a planter’s house of North Carolina,
when two of these beetles were placed, without his knowledge,
under the candlestick. A few blows were struck on
the table, when, to his great surprise, the candlestick began
to move about, apparently without any agency, except that
of a spiritual nature; and his surprise was not lessened
when, on taking one of them up, he discovered that it was
only a chafer that moved.<a id="Marker_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="marker">47</a></p>

<p>In Denmark, the common Dung-beetle, <i>Geotrupes stercorarius</i>,
is called <i>Skarnbosse</i> or <i>Tor(Thor)bist</i>, and an
augury as to the harvest is drawn by the peasants from
the mites which infest it. The notion is, that if there are
many of these mites between the fore feet, there will be an
early harvest, but a late one if they abound between the
hind feet.<a id="Marker_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="marker">48</a></p>

<p>In Gothland, where Thor was worshiped above and more
than the other gods, the <i>Scarabæus (Geotrupes) stercorarius</i>
was considered sacred to him, and bore the name of
Thorbagge&mdash;Thor’s-bug. “Relative to this beetle,” says
Thorpe, “a superstition still exists, which has been transmitted
from father to son, that if any one finds in his path
a Thorbagge lying helpless upon its back, and turns it on
its feet, he expiates seven sins; because Thor in the time
of heathenism was regarded as a mediator with a higher
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_29" title="29"></a><!--030.png-->
power, or All-father. On the introduction of Christianity,
the priests strove to terrify the people from the worship of
their old divinities, pronouncing both them and their adherents
to be evil spirits, and belonging to hell. On the poor
Thorbagge the name was now bestowed of Thordjefvul or
Thordyfvel&mdash;Thor-devil, by which it is still known in Sweden
Proper. No one now thinks of Thor, when he finds the helpless
creature lying on its back, but the good-natured countryman
seldom passes it without setting it on its feet, and
thinking of his sin’s atonement.”<a id="Marker_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="marker">49</a></p>

<p>A common symbol of the Creator among the Hindoos
(from whom it passed into Egypt, and thence into Scandinavia,
says Bjornstjerna) was the <i>Scarabæus (Ateuchus)
sacer</i>, commonly called the Sacred-beetle of the Egyptians.<a id="Marker_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="marker">50</a>
Of this insect we next treat at length.</p>

<p>Of the many animals worshiped by the ancient Egyptians,
one of the most celebrated, perhaps, is the insect commonly
known as the Sacred-scarab&mdash;<i>Scarabæus sacer</i>. This name
was given it by Linnæus, but later writers know it as the
<i>Ateuchus sacer</i>.<a id="Marker_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="marker">51</a> The insect is found throughout all Egypt,
in the southern part of Europe,<a id="Marker_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="marker">52</a> in China, the East Indies,
in Barbary, and at the Cape of Good Hope.<a id="Marker_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="marker">53</a></p>

<p>The <i>Ateuchus sacer</i>, however, is not the only insect that
was regarded as an object of veneration by the Egyptians;
but another species of the same genus, lately discovered in
the Sennâri by M. Caillaud de Nantes, appears to have first
fixed the attention of this people, in consequence of its more
brilliant colors, and of the country in which it was found,
which, it is supposed, was their first sojourn.<a id="Marker_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="marker">54</a> This species,
which Cuvier has named <i>Ateuchus Ægyptorum</i>, is green,
with a golden tint, while the first is black.<a id="Marker_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="marker">55</a> The <i>Buprestis</i>
and <i>Cantharus</i>, or <i>Copris</i>, were also held in high repute by
the Egyptians, and used as synonymous emblems of the
same deities as the Scarabæus. This is further confirmed
by the fact of S. Passalacqua having found a species of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_30" title="30"></a><!--031.png-->
Buprestis embalmed in a tomb at Thebes.<a id="Marker_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="marker">56</a> But the <i>Scarabæus</i>,
or <i>Ateuchus sacer</i>, is the beetle most commonly
represented, and the type of the whole class; and the one
referred to in this article under the general name of <i>Scarabæus</i>,
unless when otherwise particularly mentioned.</p>

<p>The Scarabæus, according to the beliefs of the ancient
Egyptians, was sacred to the Sun and to Pthah, the personification
of the creative power of the Deity; and it was
adopted as an emblem or symbol <span class="no-wrap">of&mdash;</span></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The World.&mdash;According to P. Valerianus, the Scarab
was symbolical of the world, on account of the globular
form of its pellets of dung, and from an odd notion that
they were rolled from sunrise to sunset.<a id="Marker_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="marker">57</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Sun.&mdash;P. Valerianus supposes this insect to have
been a symbol of the sun, because of the angular projection
from its head resembling rays, and from the thirty joints of
the six tarsi of its feet answering to the days of an (ordinary)
solar month.<a id="Marker_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="marker">58</a> According to Plutarch, it was because
these insects cast the seed of generation into round balls of
dung, as a genial nidus, and roll them backward with their
feet, while they themselves look directly forward. And as
the sun appears to proceed in the heavens in a course contrary
to the signs, thus the Scarabæi turn their balls toward
the west, while they themselves continue creeping toward
the east; by the first of these motions exhibiting the diurnal,
and by the second the annual, motion of the earth and the
planets.<a id="Marker_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="marker">59</a> Porphyry gives the same reason as Plutarch
why the beetle was considered, as he calls it, “a living
image of the sun.”<a id="Marker_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="marker">60</a> Horapollo assigns two reasons for the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_31" title="31"></a><!--032.png-->
Scarab being taken as an emblem of the sun. He tells us
there are three species of beetles: one of which has the
form of a cat, and is radiated;<a id="Marker_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="marker">61</a> and this one from a supposed
analogy the Egyptians have dedicated to the Sun,
because, first, the statue of the Deity of Heliopolis (City of
the Sun) has the form of a cat!<a id="Marker_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="marker">62</a> In this, however, Wilkinson
asserts, that Horapollo is wrong; for the Deity of
Heliopolis, under the form of a cat, was the emblem of Bubastis,
and not of Rê, a type of the sun; and the presence of
her statue is explained by the custom of each city assigning
to the Divinities of neighboring places a conspicuous
post in its own temples; and Bubastis was one of the principal
contemplar Deities of Heliopolis.<a id="Marker_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="marker">63</a> The second reason
of Horapollo is, that this insect has thirty fingers, which
correspond to the thirty days of a solar month.<a id="Marker_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="marker">64</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Moon.&mdash;The second of the three species of beetles,
described by Horapollo, has, according to this writer, two
horns, and the character of a bull; and it was consecrated
to the moon; whence the Egyptians say, that the bull in
the heavens is the elevation of this Goddess. This statement
of beetle “with two horns” (the <i>Copris Isidis</i>) consecrated
to the moon, Wilkinson says is not confirmed by
the sculptures where it is never introduced.<a id="Marker_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="marker">65</a></p>

<p>It is said the Egyptians believed that the pellet of the
Scarabæus remained in the ground for a period of twenty-eight
days. May not this have some connection with their
choosing the insect as a symbol of the moon which divides
the year into months of twenty-eight days each; or, of the
month itself (of which we shall notice it was also a symbol)
for the same reason? I have seen, too, a Scarabæus engraved
upon a seal, the joints of whose tarsi numbered but
twenty-eight.</p>

<p>Conformable to this supposition, the following quotation
may be given from that chapter of the Treasvrie of Auncient
and Modern Times devoted to the “Many meruailous
(marvelous) properties in sundrie things; and to what
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_32" title="32"></a><!--033.png-->
Stars and Planets they are subjected naturally,” where we
find mention of the Scarab as being subject to the moon:
“The <i>Scarabe</i>, which is otherwise commonly called the
Beetle-flye, a little old Creature, is maruelously subject to
the Moon, and thereof is found both written, and by experience:
That she gathereth or little pellets, or little round
bals, and therein encloseth her young Egges, keeping the
Pellets hid in the ground eight and twenty daies; during
which time the Moone maketh her course, and the nine and
twentieth day shee taketh them forth, and then hideth them
againe vnder the Earth. Then, at such time as the Moone
is conioyned with the Sunne, which wee vsually tearme the
New Moone: they all issue forth aliue, and flye about.”<a id="Marker_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="marker">66</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mercury.&mdash;The third of the three species of beetles,
described by Horapollo, has one horn, and a peculiar form;
and it is supposed, like the Ibis, to refer to Mercury.<a id="Marker_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="marker">67</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Courageous Warrior.&mdash;As such they forced all the
soldiers to wear rings, upon each of which a beetle was
engraved, <i>i.e.</i> an animal perpetually in armor, who went
his rounds in the night.<a id="Marker_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="marker">68</a> Plutarch thus alludes to this custom:
“In the signet or seal-ring of their martial and military
men, there was engraven the portraeture of the great
Fly called the Beettil;” and assigns this curious and ridiculous
reason, “because in that kinde there is no female, but
they be all males.”<a id="Marker_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="marker">69</a> The custom is also mentioned by
Ælian;<a id="Marker_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="marker">70</a> and some Scarabs have been found perfect, set in
gold, with the ring attached.<a id="Marker_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="marker">71</a> The Romans adopted this
emblem and made it a part of some legionary standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pthah, the Creative Power.&mdash;Plutarch says, that in
consequence of there being no females of this species, but
all males, they were considered fit types of the creative
power, self-acting and self-sufficient.<a id="Marker_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="marker">72</a> Some, too, have
supposed that its position upon the female figure of the
heavens, which encircles the zodiacs, refers to the same
singular idea of its generative influence.<a id="Marker_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="marker">73</a></p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_33" title="33"></a></li>
<!--034.png-->
<li>
<p>Pthah Tore, another character of the creative power.<a id="Marker_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="marker">74</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pthah-Sokari-Osiris.&mdash;Of this pigmy Deity of Memphis,
it was adopted as a distinctive mark, being placed on
his head.<a id="Marker_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="marker">75</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regeneration, or reproduction, from the fact of its
being the first living animal observed upon the subsidence
of the waters of the Nile.<a id="Marker_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="marker">76</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spring.<a id="Marker_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="marker">77</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Egyptian month anterior to the rising of the
Nile, as it appears first in that month.<a id="Marker_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="marker">78</a> It also may have
been a symbol of a lunar month from an above-mentioned
belief, namely, that its pellets remain twenty-eight days in
the ground. It is sometimes found with the joints of its
tarsi numbering but twenty-eight instead of thirty, hence
the supposition is that it was held as a symbol of a lunar,
as well as a solar, month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fecundity.&mdash;Dr. Clarke informs us that these beetles
are even yet eaten by the women to render them prolific.<a id="Marker_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="marker">79</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the eyes pierced by a needle, of a man who
died from fever.<a id="Marker_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="marker">80</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surrounded by roses, of a voluptuary, because they
thought that the smell of that flower enervated, made
lethargic, and killed the beetle.<a id="Marker_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="marker">81</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An only son; because, says Fosbroke, they believed
that every beetle was “both male and female.”<a id="Marker_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="marker">82</a> Was it
not because they imagined these insects were all males, as
above stated upon the authority of Plutarch, and hence the
analogy in a family of an only son since it could be but of
the masculine gender?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The Scarabæus was also connected with astronomical
subjects, occurring in some zodiacs in the place of Cancer;
and with funereal rites.<a id="Marker_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="marker">83</a></p>

<p>To no place in particular, as the dog at Cynopolis, the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_34" title="34"></a><!--035.png-->
ichneumon at Heracleopolis, was the worship of the beetle
confined; but traces of it are found throughout the whole
of Egypt. It is probable, however, it received the greatest
honors at Memphis and Heliopolis, of which cities Pthah
and the Sun were the chief Deities.<a id="Marker_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="marker">84</a> The worship is also
of great antiquity, for in many of the above-mentioned
characters, the beetle occurs upon the royal sepulchers of
Biban-el-Moluc, which are said to be more ancient than the
Pyramids.<a id="Marker_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="marker">85</a> Scarabæi are, in fact, to be retraced in all their
monuments and sculptures, and under divers positions, and
often depicted of gigantic dimensions. Mr. Hamilton tells
us that in the most conspicuous part of the magnificent
temple which marks the site of the ancient Ombite nome,
priests are represented paying divine honors to this beetle,
placed upon an altar; and, that it might have a character
of more mysterious sanctity, it was generally figured with
two mitered heads&mdash;that of the common hawk, and that of
the ram with the horn of Ammon.<a id="Marker_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="marker">86</a> It may be remarked
here, that the Scarabæus, when represented with the head
of a hawk, or of a ram, is meant to be an emblem of the
sun; and as such emblem it is most commonly found. It
often occurs in a boat with extended wings, holding the
globe of the sun in its claws, or elevated in the firmament
as a type of that luminary in the meridian. Figures too
of other Deities are often seen praying to it when in this
character.<a id="Marker_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="marker">87</a></p>

<p>In the cabinet of Montfaucon, there is a Scarabæus in
the middle of a large stone, with outspread feet; and two
men, or women, who are perhaps priests, or priestesses,
stand before it with clasped hands as if in adoration.<a id="Marker_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="marker">88</a> This
gentleman also has remarked that on the Isiac table, there
is the figure of a man in a sitting posture, who holds his
hands toward a beetle which has the head of a man with
a crescent upon it.<a id="Marker_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="marker">89</a> On this table there is another Scarab
with the head of Isis.<a id="Marker_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="marker">90</a> Besides these Scarabæi with the
heads of hawks, rams, men, and the goddess Isis, Mr.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_35" title="35"></a><!--036.png-->
Hertz has in his possession a small Scarabæus in stone
with the head of a cow.<a id="Marker_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="marker">91</a></p>

<p>The mode of representing the Scarabæi on the monuments
was frequently very arbitrary. Some are figured
with, and some without the scutellum; and others are
sometimes introduced with two scutella, one on either
clypeus. An instance of this mode of representation, of
which no example is to be found in nature, occurs in a large
Scarabæus in the British museum.<a id="Marker_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="marker">92</a></p>

<p>Among the ideographics of the hieroglyphic writing, the
Scarabæus is found under several forms: seated with
closed and spread wings upon the head of a god, it signifies
the name of a god&mdash;a Creator;<a id="Marker_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="marker">93</a> and with the head and
legs of a man, it is emblematic of the same creative power,
or of Pthah. Another emblem of Pthah is supported by
the arms of a man kneeling on the heavens, and surmounted
by a winged Scarab supporting a globe or sun.<a id="Marker_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="marker">94</a></p>

<p>The Scarabæus likewise belongs to the hieroglyphic
signs as a syllabic phonetic; and with complement a
mouth, signifies type, form, and transformation: flying, to
mount&mdash;a phonetic of the later alphabet, with sound of H
in the name of Pthah. Another phonetic of the later alphabet,
belonging to the <span class="smaller">XXVI.</span> dynasty, of the time of Domitianus
and Trajanus, was a Scarabæus in repose.<a id="Marker_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="marker">95</a></p>

<p>The Scarabæus entered also into the royal scutcheons.
It first appeared in the <span class="smaller">XI.</span> dynasty, and is found afterward
in the <span class="smaller">XII.</span>, <span class="smaller">XIII.</span>, <span class="smaller">XIV.</span>, <span class="smaller">XVIII.</span>, <span class="smaller">XIX.</span>, <span class="smaller">XX.</span>, <span class="smaller">XXI.</span>, <span class="smaller">XXII.</span>, <span class="smaller">XXIII.</span>,
and <span class="smaller">XXX.</span><a id="Marker_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="marker">96</a></p>

<p>The most important monuments of the great edifice of
Amenophis&mdash;the so-called Palace of Luxon,&mdash;in an historical
sense, are said to be four great Scarabæi. They contain
statements as to the frontier of the Egyptian empire under
Amenophis at the time of his marriage with Taja. Rosellini
has given copies and explanations of two of them. A
third, now in the Louvre, states that the King, conqueror
of the Lybian Shepherds, husband of Taja, made the foreign
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_36" title="36"></a><!--037.png-->
country of the Karai his southern frontier, the foreign land
of Nharina (Mesopotamia) his northern. The inscription
of the other Scarabæus, now in the Vatican, states that in
the eleventh year and third month of his reign, King Amenhept
made a great tank or lake to celebrate the festival of
the waters; on which occasion he entered it in a barge of
“the most gracious Disc of the Sun.” This substitution,
by the King, of the barge of the Disc of the Sun for the
usual barge of Amun-Ra, is the <em>first</em> indication of an heretical
sun-worship.<a id="Marker_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="marker">97</a></p>

<p>Such historical Scarabæi, Champollion and Rosellini
have happily compared to commemorative coins; and, in
fact, those which record the names of the kings might perhaps
be considered as small Egyptian coins.<a id="Marker_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="marker">98</a></p>

<p>Besides being ensculped upon monuments and tablets,
Scarabæi, as images in baked earth, are found in great
numbers with the mummies of Egypt. These little figures
also present an intermingling of several animal forms; for
some are found with the heads of men, others with those
of dogs, lions, and cats, and others are figures entirely
fantastical. Father Kirker says, they were interred with
the dead to drive away evil spirits; and there is much
probability, he continues, that these were put here for no
other purpose than to protect their relatives.<a id="Marker_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="marker">99</a> The largest
of these rude images of Scarabæi, thus used for funereal
purposes, frequently had a prayer, or legend connected with
the dead, engraved upon them; and a winged Scarabæus was
generally placed on those bodies which were embalmed according
to the most extensive process.<a id="Marker_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="marker">100</a> These latter are
found in various positions, but generally upon the eye and
breast of the body.<a id="Marker_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="marker">101</a> Placed over the stomach, it was deemed
a never-failing talisman to shield the “soul” of its wearer
against the terrific genii of Amenthi.<a id="Marker_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="marker">102</a></p>

<p>A small, closely cut, glazed limestone Scarabæus has
been found tied like a ring by a twist of plain cord on the
fourth finger of the left hand. This has occurred twice.
Another has been found fastened around the left wrist.<a id="Marker_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="marker">103</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_37" title="37"></a><!--038.png-->

<p>It has been remarked before that the Scarabæus was connected
with astronomical subjects. Donovan tells us that
“when sculptured on astronomical tables, or on columns, it
expressed the divine wisdom which regulated the universe
and enlightened man.”<a id="Marker_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="marker">104</a></p>

<p>From another point of view we will look now upon the
worship of the Scarabæus. When the hieroglyphics of the
<em>ancient</em> Egyptians, by reason of their antiquity, became unintelligible,
and, in consequence, to the superstitious people,
sacred, they were formed into circles and borders, after the
manner of cordons, and engraved upon precious stones and
gems, by way of amulets and trinkets. It is thought this
fashion was coeval with the introduction of the worship of
Serapis by the Ptolemies.<a id="Marker_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="marker">105</a> In the second century, that sect
of the Egyptians called the Basilidians, intermingling the
new-born Christianity with their heathenism, introduced
that particular kind of mysterious hieroglyphics and figures
called Abraxas, which were supposed to have the singular
property of curing diseases.<a id="Marker_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="marker">106</a> These abraxas are generally
oval, and made of black Egyptian basalt. They are sometimes
covered with letters and characters, fac-similes of the
ancient hieroglyphics, but more commonly with the inscriptions
in the more modern letters. Besides these inscriptions,
figures of animals and scenes were also frequently represented;
and among the animals, one of frequent occurrence
was the Scarabæus. For this insect the Basilidians had the
same great veneration as their forefathers; and they paid
to it almost the same divine honors. This appears in many
abraxas, and particularly in one in the cabinet of Montfaucon,
where two women are seen standing before a beetle,
with uplifted hands, as if supplicating it to grant them some
favor. Above is a large star, or, more probably, the sun,
of which the beetle was the well-known symbol.<a id="Marker_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="marker">107</a> On another
abraxas, figured by Montfaucon, there are two birds
with human heads, which stand before a Scarab. These
figures are surrounded by a snake the ends of which meet.
Upon the other side is written in Greek characters the word
φρὴ (Phre or Phri), which in the Coptic or Egyptian language
signifies the sun.<a id="Marker_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="marker">108</a> Chifflet has figured an abraxas
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_38" title="38"></a><!--039.png-->
which contains a Scarabæus having the sun for its head,
and the arms of a man for legs.<a id="Marker_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="marker">109</a> Another, in the cabinet
of M. Capello, is remarkable for having a woman on its reverse,
who holds two infants in her arms.<a id="Marker_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="marker">110</a> Montfaucon has
also figured two others, given by Fabreti; and Count Caylus
has engraved one, which represents a woman’s head
upon the body of a Scarab. The head is that of Isis.<a id="Marker_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="marker">111</a> As
these beetles differ much in form, it may be there are several
species. To the abraxas succeeded the talismans,
which were of the highest estimation in the East.</p>

<p>Carved Scarabæi of all sizes and qualities are quite common
in the cabinets of Europe. They were principally used
for sets in rings, necklaces, and other ornamental trinkets, and
are now called Scarabæi gems,<a id="Marker_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="marker">112</a> though some suppose them
to have been money. All of these gems, Winkleman says,
which have a beetle on the convex side, and an Egyptian
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_39" title="39"></a><!--040.png-->
deity on the concave, are of a date posterior to the Ptolemies;
and, moreover, all the ordinary gems, which represent
the figures or heads of Serapis, or Anubis, are of the
Roman era.<a id="Marker_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="marker">113</a> According to C. Caylus, the Egyptians used
these gems for amulets, and made them of all substances
except metal. They preferred, however, those of pottery,
covered with green and black enamel. Cylinders, squares,
and pyramids were first used; then came the Scarabæi,
which were the last forms. They now began to have the
appearance of seals or stamps, and many believe them to
have been such. The body of the beetle being a convenient
hold for the hand, and the base a place of safety and facility
to engrave whatsoever was wished to be stamped or printed.
Many of these characters are as yet unintelligible. These
seals are made of the most durable stones, and their convex
part commonly worked without much art.</p>

<p>The Egyptian form of the Scarabæus, which somewhat
resembled a half-walnut, the Etruscans adopted in the
manufacture of their gems. These scarcely exceed the
natural size of the Scarabæus which they have on the convex
side. They have also a hole drilled through them
lengthwise, for suspension from the neck, or annexation to
some other part of the person. They are generally cornelians.
Some are of a style very ancient, and of extremely
precious work, although in the Etruscan manner, which is
correctness of design in the figures, and hardness in the
turn of the muscles.</p>

<p>The Greeks also made use of the Scarabæus in their
gems; but in the end they suppressed the insect, and preserved
alone the oval form which the base presented, for
the body of the sculpture. They also mounted them in
their rings.<a id="Marker_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="marker">114</a></p>

<p>Several Egyptian Scarabæi were among the relics discovered
by Layard at Arban on the banks of the Khabour;
and similar objects have been brought from Nimroud, and
various other ruins in Assyria.<a id="Marker_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="marker">115</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_40" title="40"></a><!--041.png-->

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_41" title="41"></a><!--042.png-->
ornaments the figures of Scarabs. Those on the cubes are
with outstretched wings, inlaid with gold. The cubes have
much the appearance of weights.<a id="Marker_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="marker">116</a></p>

<p>The Scarabæus was not only venerated when alive, but
embalmed after death. In that state they are found at
Thebes. It, however, was not the only insect thus honored,
for in one of the heads brought by Mr. Wilkinson from
Thebes, several others were discovered. These were submitted
to Mr. Hope for examination; and the species ascertained
by this gentleman, Mr. Pettigrew has enumerated as
follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Corynetes violaceous, <i>Fab.</i></li>

<li>Necrobia mumiarum, <i>Hope</i>.</li>

<li>Dermestes vulpinus, <i>Fab.</i></li>

</ol>

<hr />

<p>Concerning the worship in general of the Scarabæus,
many curious observations have been made besides the
ones above recorded.</p>

<p>Pliny, in the words of his ancient translator, Philemon
Holland, tells us “The greater part of Ægypt honour all
beetles, and adore them as gods, or at leastwise having
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_42" title="42"></a><!--043.png-->
some divine power in them: which ceremoniall devotion
of theirs, Appion giveth a subtile and curious reason of;
for he doth collect, that there is some resemblance between
the operations and works of the Sun, and this flie; and this
he setteth abroad, for to colour and excuse his countrymen.”<a id="Marker_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="marker">119</a></p>

<p>Dr. Molyneux, in the conclusion of his article on the
swarms of beetles that appeared in Ireland in 1688, makes
the following allusion to the worship of the Scarabæus by
the Egyptians: “It is also more than probable that this
same destructive Beetle (Hedge-chafer&mdash;<i>Melontha vulgaris</i>)
we are speaking of, was that very kind of <i>Scarabæus</i> the
idolatrous <i>Ægyptians</i> of old had in such high veneration,
as to pay divine worship to it. For nothing can be supposed
more natural, than to imagine a Nation addicted to
Polytheism, as the <i>Ægyptians</i> were, in a Country frequently
suffering great Mischief and Scarcity from Swarms
of devouring Insects, should from a strong Sense and Fear
of Evil to come (the common Principle of Superstition and
Idolatry) give sacred worship to the visible Authors of
these their Sufferings, in hopes to render them more propitious
for the future. Thus ’tis allowed on all hands, that
the same People adored as a God the ravenous Crocodile of
the River Nile; and thus the <i>Romans</i>, though more polite
and civilized in their Idolatry, <i>Febrem ad minas nocendam
venerabantur, eamque variis <span class="normal">Templis extructis</span> colebant</i>,
says Valerius Maximus, L. 2, c. 5.”<a id="Marker_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="marker">120</a></p>

<p>It is curious to observe how the reason is affected by circumstances.
The mind of Dr. Molyneux being long engaged
upon the destruction caused by insects, worked itself insensibly
into certain grooves, out of which it was afterward impossible
to act. The same may be remarked of Mr. Henry
Baker, as appears from his article, “On a <i>Beetle</i> that lived
three years without Food.” In conclusion, this gentleman
says, “As the <i>Egyptians</i> were a wise and learned people,
we cannot imagine they would show so much regard to a
creature of such a mean appearance (as the Beetle) without
some extraordinary reason for so doing. And is it not
possible they might have discovered its being able to subsist
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_43" title="43"></a><!--044.png-->
a very long time without any visible sustenance, and therefore
made it a symbol of the Deity?”<a id="Marker_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="marker">121</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_44" title="44"></a><!--045.png-->

<p>In parts of Europe the ladies string together for necklaces
the burnished violet-colored thighs of the <i>Geotrupes
stercorarius</i> and such like brilliant species of insects.<a id="Marker_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="marker">122</a></p>

<p>Under <i>Copris molossus</i>, in Donovan’s Insects of China,
it is mentioned that the larvæ of the larger kinds of coleopterous
insects, abounding in unctuous moisture, are much
esteemed as food by the Chinese. “Under the roots of
the canes is found a large, white grub, which, being fried
in oil, is eaten as a dainty by the Chinese.” Donovan suggests
that perhaps this is the larvæ of the <i>Scarabæus
(copris) molossus</i>, the general description and abundance
of which insect in China favors such an opinion.<a id="Marker_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="marker">123</a></p>

<p>Insects belonging to the family Scarabæidæ have been
used also in medicine. Pliny says the green Scarabæus has
the property of rendering the sight more piercing of those
who gaze upon it, and that hence, engravers of precious
stones use these insects to steady their sight.<a id="Marker_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="marker">124</a></p>

<p>Again, he says: “And many there be, who, by the directions
of magicians, carrie about them in like manner,” <i>i.e.</i>
tied up in a linen cloth with a red string, and attached to
the body, “for the quartan ague, one of these flies or beetles
that use to roll up little balls of earth.”<a id="Marker_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="marker">125</a> We learn
from Schroder (v. 345) that the powder of the <i>Scarabæus
pilurarius</i> “sprinkled upon a protuberating eye or prolapsed
anus, is said to afford singular relief;” and that “an
oil prepared of these insects by boiling in oil till they are
consumed, and applied to the blind hæmorrhoids, by means
of a piece of cotton, is said to mitigate the pains thereof.”<a id="Marker_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="marker">126</a>
Fabricius states that the <i>Scarabæus (copris) molossus</i> is
medicinally employed in China.<a id="Marker_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="marker">127</a></p>

<p>We quote the following from Moufet: “The Beetle engraven
on an emerald yeelds a present remedy against all
witchcrafts, and no less effectual than that moly which Mercury
once gave Ulysses. Nor is it good only against
these, but it is also very useful, if any one be about to go
before the king upon any occasion, so that such a ring
ought especially to be worn by them that intend to beg of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_45" title="45"></a><!--046.png-->
noblemen some jolly preferment or some rich province. It
keeps away likewise the head-ach, which, truly, is no small
mischief, especially to great drinkers.…</p>

<p>“The magicians will scarce finde credit, when foolishly
rather than truly, they report and imagine that the precious
stone Chelonitis, that is adorned with golden spots, put
into hot water with a Beetle, raiseth tempests.” <i>Pliny</i>, <i>l.</i>
37, <i>c.</i> 10.</p>

<p>“The eagle, the Beetle’s proud and cruel enemy, does no
less make havock of and devour this creature of so mean
a rank, yet as soon as it gets an opportunity, it returneth
like for like, and sufficiently punisheth that spoiler. For it
flyeth up nimbly into her nest with its fellow-soldiers, the
Scara-beetles, and in the absence of the old she eagle bringeth
out of the nest the eagle’s eggs one after another, till
there be none left; which falling, and being broken, the
young ones, while they are yet unshapen, being dashed
miserably against the stones, are deprived of life, before
they can have any sense of it. Neither do I see indeed
how she should more torment the eagle than in her young
ones. For some who slight the greatest torments of their
own body, cannot endure the least torments of their sons.”<a id="Marker_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="marker">128</a></p>

<p>Pliny says that in Thrace, near Olynthus, there is a
small locality, the only one in which the beetle<a id="Marker_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="marker">129</a> cannot exist;
from which circumstance it has received the name of
“Cantharolethus&mdash;Fatal-to-the-Beetle.”<a id="Marker_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="marker">130</a></p>


<h3 id="Dynastidae_Hercules-beetle_etc">Dynastidæ&mdash;Hercules-beetle, etc.</h3>

<p>The Hercules-beetle, <i>Dynastes Hercules</i>, is four, five,
or even sometimes six inches long, and a native of South
America. It is said great numbers of these immense insects
are sometimes seen on the Mammæa-tree, rasping off
the rind of the slender branches by working nimbly round
them with their horns, till they cause the juice to flow,
which they drink to intoxication, and thus fall senseless to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_46" title="46"></a><!--047.png-->
the ground! These stories, however, as the learned Fabricius
has well observed, seem not very probable; since the
thoracic horn, being bearded on its lower surface, would
undoubtedly be made bare by this operation.<a id="Marker_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="marker">131</a></p>

<p>Col. St. Clair, though he confesses he never could take
one of these insects in the act of sawing off the limbs of
trees, or ascertain what they worked for, gravely repeats
the above old story, and says that during the operation they
make a noise exactly like that of a knife-grinder holding
steel against the stone of his wheel; but a thousand knife-grinders
at work at the same moment, he continues, could
not equal their noise! He calls this beetle hence the
knife-grinder.<a id="Marker_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="marker">132</a></p>

<p>The Goliath-beetle, <i>Dynastes Goliathus</i>, is said to be
roasted and eaten by the natives of South America and
Africa.<a id="Marker_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="marker">133</a></p>

<p>The enormous prices of £30, £40, and even £50 used to
be asked for these latter beetles a piece; fine specimens for
cabinets even now bring from five to six pounds.<a id="Marker_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="marker">134</a></p>

<p>The large pulpy larva of a species of Dynastidæ&mdash;the
<i>Oryctes rhinoceros</i>, called by the Singhalese <i>Gascooroominiya</i>&mdash;is,
notwithstanding its repulsive aspect, esteemed
a luxury by the Malabar coolies.<a id="Marker_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="marker">135</a></p>

<p>Immediately after mentioning the above fact, Tennent
records the following interesting superstition respecting a
beetle when found in a house after sunset:</p>

<p>“Among the superstitions of the Singhalese arising out
of their belief in demonology, one remarkable one is connected
with the appearance of a beetle when observed on
the floor of a dwelling-house after nightfall. The popular
belief is that in obedience to a certain form of incantation
(called <i>cooroominiya-pilli</i>) a demon in shape of a beetle is
sent to the house of some person or family whose destruction
it is intended to compass, and who presently falls sick
and dies. The only means of averting this catastrophy is,
that some one, himself an adept in necromancy, should
perform a counter-charm, the effect of which is to send
back the disguised beetle to destroy his original employer;
for in such a conjuncture the death of one or the other
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_47" title="47"></a><!--048.png-->
is essential to appease the demon whose intervention has
been invoked. Hence the discomfort of a Singhalese on
finding a beetle in his house after sunset, and his anxiety
to expel but not kill it.”<a id="Marker_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="marker">136</a></p>

<p>The <i>Dynastes Goliathus</i>, Moufet says, “like to beetles
(<i>Ateuchus sacer</i>), hath no female, but it shapes its own
form itself. It produceth its young one from the ground
by itself, which Joach. Camerarius did elegantly express,
when he sent to Pennius the shape of this insect out of the
storehouse of natural things of the Duke of Saxony; with
these verses:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">A bee begat me not, nor yet did I proceed</div>
<div class="line">From any female, but myself I breed.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For it dies once in a year,” continues Moufet, “and from its
own corruption, like a Phœnix, it lives again (as Moninus
witnesseth) by heat of the sun.</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">A thousand summers’ heat and winters’ cold</div>
<div class="line">When she hath felt, and that she doth grow old,</div>
<div class="line">Her life that seems a burden, in a tomb</div>
<div class="line">O’ spices laid, comes younger in her room.”<a id="Marker_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="marker">137</a></div>
</div>
</div>


<h3 id="Melolonthidae_Cock-chafers">Melolonthidæ&mdash;Cock-chafers.</h3>

<p>The family of insects, commonly called <i>Cock-chafers</i>,
<i>Hedge-chafers</i>, <i>May-bugs</i>, and <i>Dorrs</i> (from the Irish
<i>dord</i>, humming, buzzing, or from the Anglo-Saxon <i>dora</i>,
a locust or drone) have been included by Fabricius in the
genus <i>Melolontha</i>,&mdash;a word which retains an odd notion of
the Greeks respecting them, viz., that they were produced
from or with the flowers of apple-trees. It is a name
also by which the Greeks themselves used to distinguish
the same kind of insects.</p>

<p>In Sweden the peasants look upon the grub of the Cock-chafer,
<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>, as furnishing an unfailing
prognostic whether the ensuing winter will be mild or
severe; if the animal have a bluish hue (a circumstance
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_48" title="48"></a><!--049.png-->
which arises from its being replete with food), they affirm it
will be mild, but on the contrary if it be white, the weather
will be severe: and they carry this so far as to foretell, that
if the anterior be white and the posterior blue, the cold will
be most severe at the beginning of the winter. Hence they
call this grub <i>Bemärkelse-mask</i>&mdash;prognostic worm.<a id="Marker_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="marker">138</a></p>

<p>An absurd notion obtains in England that the larvæ of
the May-bugs are changed into briers.<a id="Marker_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="marker">139</a></p>

<p>The following quotation is from the Chronicle of Hollingshed:
“The 24 day of Februarie (1575), being the
feast of Saint Matthie, on which dai the faire was kept at
Tewkesburie, a strange thing happened there. For after a
floud which was not great, but such as therby the medows
neere adioning were covered with water, and in the after
noone there came downe the river of Seuerne great numbers
of flies and beetles (<i>Melolontha vulgaris?</i>), such as in summer
evenings use to strike men in the face, in great heapes,
a foot thicke above the water, so that to credible mens
judgement there were seene within a paire of buts length of
those flies above a hundred quarters. The mils there
abouts were dammed up with them for the space of foure
daies after, and then were clensed by digging them out
with shovels: from whence they came is yet unknowne but
the daie was cold and a hard frost.”<a id="Marker_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="marker">140</a></p>

<p>Such another remarkable phenomenon is recorded to
have occurred in Ireland, in the summer of 1688. The
Cock-chafers, in this instance, were in such immense numbers,
“that when,” as the chronicler, Dr. Molyneux, relates,
“towards evening or sunset, they would arise, disperse,
and fly about, with a strange humming noise, much like
the beating of drums at some distance; and in such vast
incredible numbers, that they darkened the air for the space
of two or three miles square. The grinding of leaves,” he
continues, “in the mouths of this vast multitude altogether,
made a sound very much resembling the sawing of timber.”<a id="Marker_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="marker">141</a></p>

<p>In a short time after the appearance of these beetles in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_49" title="49"></a><!--050.png-->
these immense numbers, they had so entirely eaten up and
destroyed the leaves of the trees, that the whole country,
for miles around, though in the middle of summer, was left
as bare as in the depth of winter.</p>

<p>During the unfavorable seasons of the weather, which
followed this plague, the swine and poultry would watch
under the trees for the falling of the beetles, and feed and
fatten upon them; and even the poorer sort of the country
people, the country then laboring under a scarcity of provision,
had a way of dressing them, and <em>lived upon them
as food</em>. In 1695, Ireland was again visited with a plague
of this same kind.<a id="Marker_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="marker">142</a></p>

<p>In Normandy, according to Mouffet, the Cock-chafers
make their appearance every third year.<a id="Marker_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="marker">143</a> In 1785, many
provinces of France were so ravaged by them, that a premium
was offered by the government for the best mode of
destroying them.<a id="Marker_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="marker">144</a> During this year, a farmer, near Blois,
employed a number of children and the poorer people to
destroy the Cock-chafers at the rate of two liards a hundred,
and in a few days they collected fourteen thousand.<a id="Marker_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="marker">145</a></p>

<p>The county of Norfolk in England seems occasionally to
have suffered much from the ravages of these insects; and
Bingley tells us that “about sixty years ago, a farm near
Norwich was so infested with them, that the farmer and his
servants affirmed they had gathered eighty bushels of them;
and the grubs had done so much injury, that the court of
the city, in compassion to the poor fellow’s misfortune, allowed
him twenty-five pounds.”<a id="Marker_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="marker">146</a></p>

<p>The seeming blunders and stupidity of these insects have
long been proverbial, as in the expressions, “blind as a
beetle,” and “beetle-headed.”</p>


<h3 id="Cetoniidae_Rose-chafers">Cetoniidæ&mdash;Rose-chafers.</h3>

<p>A very pretty species of the <i>Cetoniidæ</i>, the <i>Agestrata
luconica</i>, is of a fine brilliant metallic green, and found in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_50" title="50"></a><!--051.png-->
the Philippine Islands. These the ladies of Manilla keep as
pets in small bamboo cages, and carry them about with them
wheresoever they may go.<a id="Marker_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="marker">147</a></p>


<h3 id="Buprestidae_Burn-cows">Buprestidæ&mdash;Burn-cows.</h3>

<p>Many species of the <i>Buprestidæ</i> are decorated with
highly brilliant metallic tints, like polished gold upon an
emerald ground, or azure upon a ground of gold; and their
elytra, or wing-coverings, are employed by the ladies of
China, and also of England, for the purpose of embroidering
their dresses.<a id="Marker_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="marker">148</a> The Chinese have also attempted imitations
of these insects in bronze, in which they succeed so
well that the copy may be sometimes mistaken for the
reality.<a id="Marker_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="marker">149</a> In Ceylon<a id="Marker_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="marker">150</a> and throughout India,<a id="Marker_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="marker">151</a> the golden
wing-cases of two of this tribe, the <i>Sternocera chrysis</i> and
<i>S. sternicornis</i>, are used to enrich the embroidery of the
Indian zenana, while the lustrous joints of the legs are
strung on silken threads, and form necklaces and bracelets
of singular brilliancy. The <i>Buprestis attenuata</i>, <i>ocellata</i>
and <i>vittata</i> are also wrought into various devices and trinkets
by the Indians. The <i>B. vittata</i> is much admired among
them. This insect is found in great abundance in China,
and thence exported into India, where it is distributed at a
low price.<a id="Marker_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="marker">152</a></p>

<p>Mr. Osbeck saw in China a <i>Buprestis maxima</i>, which
had been dried, and to which were fastened leaden wings
so painted as to make them look like the wings of butterflies.
This artificial monster, he adds, was to be sold in the vaults
among other trifles.<a id="Marker_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="marker">153</a> The <i>B. maxima</i> is set up along with
Butterflies in small boxes, and vended in the streets of
Chinese cities.<a id="Marker_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="marker">154</a></p>

<p>So many species of the <i>Buprestidæ</i> are clothed with
such brilliant colors, that Geoffroy has thought proper
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_51" title="51"></a><!--052.png-->
to designate them all under the generic appellation of <i>Richard</i>.
The origin of this name is as singular as its application
is fantastical. It was originally given to the Jay, in
consequence of the facility with which that bird was taught
to pronounce the word.<a id="Marker_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="marker">155</a></p>

<p>Modern writers have been much divided in their opinion
as to what genus the celebrated <i>Buprestis</i> of the ancients
belongs. All indeed have regarded it as of the order Coleoptera,
but here their agreement ceases. Linnæus seems to
have looked upon it as a species of the genus to which he
has given its name. Geoffroy thinks it to be a <i>Carabus</i> or
<i>Cicindela;</i> M. Latrielle, to the genus <i>Melöe;</i> and Kirby
and Spence to <i>Mylabris</i>.<a id="Marker_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="marker">156</a></p>

<p>Of this Buprestis, Pliny says: “Incorporat with goat
sewer, it taketh away the tettars called lichenes that be in
the face.”<a id="Marker_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="marker">157</a> And Dr. James says that insects of this family
“are all in common, inseptic, exulcerating, and (possess) a
heating quality; for which reason, they are mixed up with
medicines adapted to the cure of a Carcinoma, Lepra, and
the malignant Lichen. Mixed in emollient pessaries, they
provoke the Catamenial discharges.”<a id="Marker_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="marker">158</a></p>

<p>The Greeks, it is said, commended the Buprestis in food.<a id="Marker_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="marker">159</a></p>


<h3 id="Elateridae_Fire-flies_Spring-beetles_etc">Elateridæ&mdash;Fire-flies, Spring-beetles, etc.</h3>

<p>In an historical sense, the most interesting species of the
family <i>Elateridæ</i> is the <i>Elater noctilucus</i>, a native of the
West Indies, and called by the inhabitants, <i>Cucujus</i>. From
an ancient translation of Peter Martyr’s History of the West
Indies, we make the following quotation, which contains
many curious facts relative to this insect:</p>

<p>“Whoso wanteth <i>Cucuji</i>, goeth out of the house in the
first twilight of the night, carrying a burning fier-brande in
his hande, and ascendeth the next hillocke, that the <i>Cucuji</i>
may see it, and swingeth the fier-brande about calling
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_52" title="52"></a><!--053.png-->
<i>Cucuji</i> aloud, and beating the ayre with often calling and
crying out <i>Cucuji, Cucuji</i>.… Beholde the desired number
of <i>Cucuji</i>, at what time, the hunter casteth the fier-brande
out of his hande. Some <i>Cucuji</i> sometimes followeth
the fier-brande, and lighteth on the grounde, then is he
easily taken.… The hunter havinge the hunting <i>Cucuius</i>,
returneth home, and shutting the doore of the house, letteth
the praye goe. The <i>Cucuius</i> loosed, swiftly flyeth about
the whole house seeking gnatts, under their hanging bedds,
and about the faces of them that sleepe, whiche the gnattes
used to assayle, they seem to execute the office of watchmen,
that such as are shut in, may quietly rest. Another
pleasant and profitable commodity proceedeth from the
<i>Cucuji</i>. As many eyes as every <i>Cucuius</i> openeth, the
host enjoyeth the light of so many candles: so that the
Inhabitants spinne, sewe, weave, and daunce by the light
of the flying <i>Cucuji</i>. The Inhabitants think that the
<i>Cucuius</i> is delighted with the harmony and melodie of
their singing, and that he also exerciseth his motion in the
ayre according to the action of their dancing.… Our men
also read and write by that light, which always continueth
untill hee have gotten enough gnatts whereby he may be
well fedd.… There is also another wonderfull commodity
proceeding from the <i>Cucuius:</i> the Islanders, appoynted by
our menn, goe with their good will by night with 2 <i>Cucuji</i>
tyed to the great tooes of their feete: (for the travailer<a id="Marker_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="marker">160</a>
goeth better by direction of the lights of the <i>Cucuji</i>, then
if hee brought so many candels with him, as the <i>Cucuji</i>
open eyes) he also carryeth another <i>Cucuius</i> in his hande
to seeke the Utiae by night (Utiae are a certayne kind of
Cony, a little exceeding a mouse in bignesse.)… They
also go a fishing by the lights of the <i>Cucuji</i>.… In sport,
and merriment, or to the intent to terrifie such as are affrayed
of every shaddow, they say that many wanton wild fellowes
sometimes rubbed their faces by night with the fleshe
of a <i>Cucuius</i> being killed, with purpose to meete their neighbors
with a flaming countenance … for the face being
annointed with the lumpe or fleshy parte of the <i>Cucuius</i>,
shineth like a flame of fire.”<a id="Marker_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="marker">161</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_53" title="53"></a><!--054.png-->

<p>At Cumana, the use of the Cucujus is forbidden, as the
young Spanish ladies used to carry on a correspondence at
night with their lovers by means of the light derived from
them.<a id="Marker_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="marker">162</a></p>

<p>Captain Stedman tells us, that one of his sentinels, one
night, called out that he saw a negro, with a lighted tobacco-pipe,
cross a creek near by in a canoe. At which alarm
they lost no time in leaping out of their hammocks, and
were not a little mortified when they found the pipe was
nothing more than a Fire-fly on the wing.<a id="Marker_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="marker">163</a></p>

<p>An individual of this species, brought to Paris in some
wood, in the larva or nymph state, there underwent its
metamorphosis, and by the light which it emitted, excited
the greatest surprise among many of the inhabitants of the
Faubourg St. Antoine, to whom such a phenomenon had
hitherto been unknown.<a id="Marker_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="marker">164</a></p>

<p>When Cortes and Narvaez were at war with one another
in Mexico, Bernal Diaz relates “that one night in the midst
of darkness numbers of shining Beetles (<i>Elater noctilucus</i>)
kept continually flying about, which Narvaez’s men mistook
for the lighted matches of our fire-arms, and this gave them
a vast idea of the number of our matchlocks.”<a id="Marker_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="marker">165</a> Thomas
Campanius tells us that one night the Cucuji frightened all
the soldiers at Fort Christina, in New Sweden (Pennsylvania?):
they thought they were enemies advancing toward
them with lighted torches.<a id="Marker_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="marker">166</a> Another such like story,
which is not incredible by any means, is told us by Mouffet.
He says that when Sir Thomas Cavendish and Sir Robert
Dudley first landed in the West Indies, and saw an infinite
number of moving lights in the woods, which were merely
these Elaters, they supposed that the Spaniards were advancing
upon them with lighted matches, and immediately
betook themselves to their ships.<a id="Marker_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="marker">167</a></p>

<p>The Indians of the Carribbee Islands, Ogleby remarks,
“anoint their bodies all over (at certain solemnities wherein
candles are forbidden) with the juice squeezed out of them
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_54" title="54"></a><!--055.png-->
(Cucuji), which causes them to shine like a flame of fire.”<a id="Marker_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="marker">168</a>
And in the Spanish Colonies, on certain festival days in
the month of June, these insects are collected in great numbers,
and tied as decorations all over the garments of the
young people, who gallop through the streets on horses
similarly ornamented, producing on a dark evening the
effect of a large moving body of light. On such occasions
the lover displays his gallantry by decking his mistress
with these living gems.<a id="Marker_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="marker">169</a></p>

<p>At the present day, the poorer classes of Cuba and the
other West India Islands, make use of these luminous insects
for lights in their houses. Twenty or thirty of them
put into a small wicker-work cage, and dampened a little
with water, will produce quite a brilliant light. Throughout
these islands, the Cucujus is worn by the ladies as a
most fashionable ornament. As many as fifty or a hundred
are sometimes worn on a single ball-room dress.
Capt. Stuart tells me he once saw one of these insects upon
a lady’s white collar, which at a little distance rivaled the
Kohinoor in splendor and beauty. The insect is fastened
to the dress by a pin through its body, and only worn so
long as it lives, for it loses its light when dead.</p>

<p>The statement of Humboldt is, that at the present day
in the habitations of the poorer classes of Cuba, a dozen of
Cucuji placed in a perforated gourd suffice for a light during
the night. By shaking the gourd quickly, the insect is
roused, and lights up its luminous disks. The inhabitants
employ a truthful and simple expression, in saying that a
gourd filled with Cucuji is an ever-lighted torch; and in
fact it is only extinguished by the death of the insects,
which are easily kept alive with a little sugar cane. A
lady in Trinidad told this great traveler, that during a long
and painful passage from Costa Firme, she had availed
herself of these phosphorescent insects whenever she wished
to give the breast to her child at night. The captain of
the ship would not permit any other light on board at
night, for fear of the privateers.<a id="Marker_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="marker">170</a></p>

<p>Southy has happily introduced the Cucujus in his
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_55" title="55"></a><!--056.png-->
“Madoc” as furnishing the lamp by which Coatel rescued
the British hero from the hands of the Mexican priests:</p>


<div class="poem">

<div class="line">Their lustre. By that light did Madoc first</div>
<div class="line">Behold the features of his lovely guide.</div>

</div>

<p>Darwin says: “In Jamaica, at some seasons of the year,
the Fire-flies are seen in the evening in great abundance.
When they settle on the ground, the bull-frog greedily devours
them, which seems to have given origin to a curious,
though very cruel, method of destroying these animals:
if red-hot pieces of charcoal be thrown toward them in the
dusk of the evening, they leap at them, and hastily swallow
them, mistaking them for Fire-flies, and are burnt to
death.”(!)<a id="Marker_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="marker">171</a></p>

<p>Beetles belonging to the family <i>Elateridæ</i> have been so
called from a peculiar power they have of leaping up like
a tumbler when placed on their backs, and for this reason
they have received the English appellations of <i>Spring-beetles</i>
and <i>Skip-jacks</i>, and from the noise which the operation
makes when they leap, they are also called <i>Snap</i>, <i>Watch</i>, or
<i>Click-beetle</i>, and likewise <i>Blacksmiths</i>.</p>

<p>If a Blacksmith beetle enters your house, a quarrel will
ensue which may end in blows.</p>

<p>This superstition obtains in Maryland.</p>


<h3 id="Lampyridae_Glow-worms">Lampyridæ.&mdash;Glow-worms.</h3>

<p>Antonius Thylesius Bonsentinus, following his elegant
description of the Glow-worm, gives a pretty fable of its
origin. As translated in Moufet’s Theater of Insects, his
words are these:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">This little fly shines in the air alone,</div>
<div class="line">Like sparks of fire, which when it was unknown</div>

<div class="line">May be this worm from shining in the night,</div>
<div class="line">Borrow’d its name, shining like candle bright.</div>
<div class="line">The cause is one, but divers are the names,</div>

<div class="line">Seeking her out with torch and candle light.<a id="Marker_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="marker">172</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following anecdote is related by Sir J.&nbsp;E. Smith, of
the effect of the first sight of the Italian Glow-worms upon
some Moorish ladies ignorant of such appearances. These
females had been taken prisoners at sea, and, until they
could be ransomed, lived in a house in the outskirts of
Genoa, where they were frequently visited by the respectable
inhabitants of the city; a party of whom, on going
one evening, were surprised to find the house closely shut
up, and their Moorish friends in the greatest consternation.
On inquiring into the cause, they found that some Glow-worms&mdash;<i>Pygolampis
Italica</i>&mdash;had found their way into the
building, and that the ladies within had taken it into their
heads that these brilliant guests were no other than the
troubled spirits of their relations; of which curious idea it
was some time before they could be divested.&mdash;The common
people of Italy have a superstition respecting these insects
somewhat similar, believing that they are of a spiritual
nature, and proceed out of the graves, and hence carefully
avoid them.<a id="Marker_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="marker">173</a></p>

<p>Cardan, Albertus, Gaudentinus, Mizalduo, and many
others have asserted that perpetual lights can be produced
from the Glow-worm; and that waters distilled from this
insect afford a lustre in the night. It is needless to say
these assertions are without foundation.<a id="Marker_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="marker">174</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_57" title="57"></a><!--058.png-->

<p>In India, the ladies have recourse to Fire-flies for ornaments
for their hair, when they take their evening walks.
They inclose them in nets of gauze.<a id="Marker_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="marker">175</a> And the beaux of
Italy, Sir J.&nbsp;E. Smith tells us, are accustomed in the summer
evenings to adorn the heads of the ladies with Glow-worms,
by sticking them also in their hair.<a id="Marker_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="marker">176</a></p>

<p>Never kill a Glow-worm, if you do, the country people
say, you will put “the light out of your house,”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
happiness, prosperity, or whatever blessing you may be enjoying.</p>

<p>A Glow-worm, in your path, denotes brilliant success in
all your undertakings. If one enters a house, one of the
heads of the family will shortly die. These superstitions
obtain in Maryland.</p>

<p>Of the Glow-worm&mdash;<i>Noctiluca terrestris</i>, Col. Ecphr., i.
38&mdash;Dr. James says: “The whole insect is used in medicine,
and recommended by some against the Stone. Cardan ascribes
an anodyne virtue to it.”<a id="Marker_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="marker">177</a></p>

<p>Mr. Ray, in his travels through the State of Venice, says:
“A discovery made by a certain gentleman, and communicated
to me by Francis Jessop, Esq., is, that those reputed
meteors, called in Latin <i>Ignis fatui</i>, and known in England
by the conceited names of <i>Jack with a Lanthorn</i>, and
<i>Will with a Wisp</i>, are nothing else but swarms of these
flying Glow-worms. Which, if true, we may give an easy
account of those phenomena of these supposed fires, <i>viz.</i>,
their sudden motion from place to place, and leading travelers
that follow them into bogs and precipices.”<a id="Marker_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="marker">178</a> It has been
suggested<a id="Marker_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="marker">179</a> also that the mole-cricket, <i>Gryllotalpa vulgaris</i>,<a id="Marker_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="marker">180</a>
which in its nocturnal peregrinations was supposed to be
luminous, is this notorious “Will-o’-the-wisp.”</p>

<p>Pliny says: “When Glow-worms appear, it is a common
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_58" title="58"></a><!--059.png-->
sign of the ripenesse of barley, and of sowing millet and
pannick.… And Mantuan sang to the same tune:</p>

<h3 id="Ptinidae_Death-watch_etc">Ptinidæ&mdash;Death-watch, etc.</h3>

<p>The common name of <i>Death-watch</i>, given to the <i>Anobium
tesselatum</i>, sufficiently announces the popular prejudice
against this insect; and so great is this prejudice, that, as
says an editor of Cuvier’s works, the fate of many a nervous
and superstitious patient has been accelerated by listening,
in the silence and solitude of night, to this imagined
knell of his approaching dissolution.<a id="Marker_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="marker">182</a> The learned Sir
Thomas Browne considered the superstition connected with
the Death-watch of great importance, and remarks that
“the man who could eradicate this error from the minds of
the people would save from many a cold sweat the meticulous
heads of nurses and grandmothers,”<a id="Marker_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="marker">183</a> for such persons
are firm in the belief, that</p>


<div class="poem">

<div class="line">The solemn Death-watch clicks the hour of death.</div>

</div>

<p>The witty Dean of St. Patrick endeavored to perform
this useful task by means of ridicule. And his description,
suggested, it would appear, by the old song of “A cobbler
there was, and he lived in a stall,” runs thus:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i16">                          &mdash;&mdash;A wood worm</div>
<div class="line">That lies in old wood, like a hare in her form,</div>
<div class="line">With teeth or with claws, it will bite, it will scratch;</div>
<div class="line">And chambermaids christen this worm a Death-watch;</div>
<div class="line">Because, like a watch, it always cries click.</div>
<div class="line">Then woe be to those in the house that are sick!</div>
<div class="line">For, sure as a gun, they will give up the ghost,</div>
<div class="line">If the maggot cries click when it scratches the post.</div>
<div class="line">But a kettle of scalding hot water injected,</div>
<div class="line">Infallibly cures the timber affected:</div>
<div class="line">The omen is broken, the danger is over,</div>
<div class="line">The maggot will die, and the sick will recover.</div>
</div>
</div>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_59" title="59"></a><!--060.png-->

<p>Grose, in his Antiquities, thus expresses this superstition:
“The clicking of a Death-watch is an omen of the death of
some one in the house wherein it is heard.” Watts says:
“We learn to presage approaching death in a family by
ravens and little worms, which we therefore call a Death-watch.”<a id="Marker_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="marker">184</a>
Gay, in one of his Pastorals, thus alludes to it:</p>


<div class="poem">

<p>“It will take,” says Mrs. Taylor, a writer in Harper’s
New Monthly Magazine, “a force unknown at the present
time to physiological science to eradicate the feeling of terror
and apprehension felt by almost every one on hearing
this small insect.” She herself, an entomologist, confesses to
have been very much annoyed at times by coming in contact
with this “strange nuisance;” but she was cured by an
overapplication. “I went to pay a visit,” says she, “to a
friend in the country. The first night I fancied I should
have gone mad before morning. The walls of the bed-room
were papered, and from them beat, as it were, a thousand
watches&mdash;tick, tick, tick! Turn which way I would, cover
my head under the bedclothes to suffocation, every pulse in
my body had an answering tick, tick, tick! But at last the
welcome morning dawned, and early I was down in the
library; even here every book, on shelf above shelf, was
riotous with tick, tick, tick! At the breakfast table, beneath
the plates, cups, and dishes, beat the hateful sound.
In the parlor, the withdrawing-room, the kitchen, nothing
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_60" title="60"></a><!--061.png-->
but tick, tick! The house was a huge clock, with thousands
of pendulums ticking from morning till night. I was careful
not to allow my great discomfort to annoy others. I argued
what they could tolerate, surely I could; and in a few
days habit had rendered the fearful, dreaded ticking a positive
necessity.”<a id="Marker_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="marker">187</a></p>

<p>The Death-watch commences its clicking, which is nothing
more than the call or signal by which the male and female
are led to each other, chiefly when spring is far advanced.
The sound is thus produced: Raising itself upon its hind
legs, with the body somewhat inclined, it beats its head with
great force and agility upon the plane of position. The
prevailing number of distinct strokes which it beats in succession
is from seven to nine or eleven; which circumstance,
thinks Mr. Shaw, may perhaps still add, in some degree, to
the ominous character which it bears. These strokes follow
each other quickly, and are repeated at uncertain intervals.
In old houses, where these insects abound, they may be heard
in warm weather during the whole day.<a id="Marker_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="marker">188</a></p>

<p>Baxter, in his World of Spirits, p. 203, most sensibly
observes, that “there are many things that ignorance causeth
multitudes to take for prodigies. I have had many discreet
friends that have been affrighted with the noise called a
Death-watch, whereas I have since, near three years ago, oft
found by trial that it is a noise made upon paper by a little,
nimble, running worm, just like a louse, but whiter and
quicker; and it is most usually behind a paper pasted to a
wall, especially to wainscot; and it is rarely, if ever, heard
but in the heat of summer.” Our author, however, relapses
immediately into his honest credulity, adding: “But he who
can deny it to be a prodigy, which is recorded by Melchior
Adamus, of a great and good man, who had a clock-watch
that had layen in a chest many years unused; and when he
lay dying, at eleven o’clock, of itself, in that chest, it struck
eleven in the hearing of many.”</p>

<p>In the British Apollo, 1710, ii. No. 86, is the following
query: “Why Death-watches, crickets, and weasels do come
more common against death than at any other time? <i>A.</i>
We look upon all such things as idle superstitions, for were
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_61" title="61"></a><!--062.png-->
any thing in them, bakers, brewers, inhabitants of old houses,
&amp;c., were in a melancholy condition.”</p>

<p>To an inquiry, ibid. vol. ii. No. 70, concerning a Death-watch,
whether you suppose it to be <em>a living creature</em>, answer
is given: “It is nothing but a little worm in the wood.”</p>

<p>“How many people have I seen in the most terrible palpitations,
for months together, expecting every hour the
approach of some calamity, only by a little worm, which
breeds in old wainscot, and, endeavoring to eat its way out,
makes a noise like the movement of a watch!” Secret
Memoirs of the late Mr. Duncan Campbell, 8vo. Lond.
1732, p. 61.<a id="Marker_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="marker">189</a></p>

<p>Authors were formerly not agreed concerning the insect
from which this sound of terror proceeded, some attributing
it to a kind of wood-louse, others to a spider.</p>

<p>M. Peiguot mentions an instance where, in a public
library that was but little frequented, <em>twenty-seven folio</em>
volumes were perforated in a straight line by one and the
same larva of a small insect (<i>Anobium pertinax</i> or <i>A. striatum?</i>)
in such a manner that, on passing a cord through the
perfectly round hole made by the insect, these twenty-seven
volumes could be raised at once.<a id="Marker_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="marker">190</a></p>


<h3 id="Bostrichidae_Typographer-beetles">Bostrichidæ&mdash;Typographer-beetles.</h3>

<p>The Typographer-beetle, <i>Bostrichus typographus</i>, is
so called on account of a fancied resemblance between the
paths it erodes and letters. This insect bores into the fir,
and feeds upon the soft inner bark; and in such vast numbers
that 80,000 are sometimes found in a single tree. The
ravages of this insect have long been known in Germany
under the name of <i>Wurm trökniss</i>&mdash;decay caused by worms;
and in the old liturgies of that country the animal itself is
formally mentioned under its common appellation, <i>The
Turk</i>. About the year 1665, this pest was particularly
prevalent and caused incalculable mischief. In the beginning
of the last century it again showed itself in the Hartz
forests; it reappeared in 1757, redoubled its injuries in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_62" title="62"></a><!--063.png-->
1769, and arrived at its height in 1783, when the number of
trees destroyed by it in the above-mentioned forests alone
was calculated at a million and a half, and the whole number
of insects at work at once one hundred and twenty
thousand millions. The inhabitants were threatened with
a total suspension of the working of their mines, for want
of fuel. At this period these <i>Bostrichi</i>, when arrived at
their perfect state, migrated in swarms like bees into Suabia
and Franconia. At length a succession of cold and moist
seasons, between the years 1784 and 1789, very sensibly
diminished the numbers of this scourge. In 1790 it again
appeared, however, and so late as 1796 there was great reason
to fear for the few fir-trees that were left.<a id="Marker_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="marker">191</a></p>


<h3 id="Cantharidae_Blister-flies">Cantharidæ&mdash;Blister-flies.</h3>

<p>Many species of this family of insect possess strong vesicating
powers, and are employed externally in medicine to
produce blisters, and internally as a powerful stimulant.
Taken internally, Pliny considered them a poison, and
mentions the following instance of their causing death:
Cossinus, a Roman of the Equestrian order, well known
for his intimate friendship with the Emperor Nero, being
attacked with lichen, that prince sent to Egypt for a
physician to cure him; who recommended a potion prepared
from Cantharides, and the patient was killed in consequence.<a id="Marker_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="marker">192</a>
But there is no doubt, however, Pliny adds,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_63" title="63"></a><!--064.png-->
that applied externally they are useful, in combination with
juice of Taminian grapes, and the suet of a sheep or she-goat.
They are extremely efficacious, too, continues Pliny,
for the cure of leprosy and lichens; and act as an emmenagogue
and diuretic, for which last reason Hippocrates used
to prescribe them for dropsy.<a id="Marker_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="marker">193</a></p>

<p>The vesicatory principle of the Blister-fly is called <i>Cantharidine</i>,
and has been ascertained by experiment to reside
more particularly in the wings than in other parts of the
body. Our officinal insect is the <i>Cantharis vesicatoria;</i>
and since the principal supply is from Spain, we call them
commonly <i>Spanish-flies</i>. In Italy, the <i>Mylabris cichorii</i>,
a native of the south of Europe, is used; and the <i>M. pustulata</i>,
a native of China, is used by the Chinese, who also
export it to Brazil, where it is the only species employed.
In India also a species of <i>Meloe</i> is used,<a id="Marker_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="marker">194</a> possessing all the
properties of the Spanish-fly.</p>

<p>At one time in Germany, the genus Meloe&mdash;Oil-beetles
(so called from their emitting from the joints of the legs an
oily yellowish liquor, when alarmed)&mdash;were extolled as a
specific against hydrophobia; and the oil which is expressed
from them is used in Sweden, with great success, in the
cure of rheumatism, by anointing the affected part.<a id="Marker_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="marker">195</a> Dr.
James thus enumerates the medicinal virtues of these insects:
“The Oil-beetle (<i>Scarabæus unctuosus</i> of Schroder)
is much of the nature of Cantharides, forces urine and blood,
and is of extraordinary efficacy against the bite of a mad
dog. Taken in powder, it cures the vari, or wandering
gout, as we are assured by Wierus. The liquor is, by
some, esteemed of efficacy in wounds; it is an ingredient
also in plaisters for the pestilential bubo and carbuncle, and
in antidotes; an oil is prepared by infusion of the living
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_64" title="64"></a><!--065.png-->
animals in common oil, which some use instead of oil of
Scorpions.”<a id="Marker_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="marker">196</a> In some parts of Spain, they are mingled
with the Cantharides, for the same purposes as these latter
insects. Farriers also employed, in some cases, oil in which
these insects had been macerated.<a id="Marker_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="marker">197</a></p>

<p>Pliny tells us that Cato of Utica was one time reproached
for selling poison, because when disposing of a royal property
by auction, he sold a quantity of Cantharides, at the
price of sixty thousand sesterces.<a id="Marker_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="marker">198</a></p>

<p>The natives of Guiana and Jamaica make ear-rings and
other ornaments of the elytra, or wing-coverings, of the
<i>Cantharis maxima;</i> the brilliant metallic colors of which
beetles, says Sloane, sparkle with an extraordinary lustre,
when worn by the Indians dancing in the sun.<a id="Marker_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="marker">199</a></p>

<p>Zoroaster says, that “Cantharides” will not hurt the
vines, if you macerate some in oil, and apply it to the whetstone
on which you are going to set your pruning-knives.<a id="Marker_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="marker">200</a></p>

<p>Cantharides are comparatively rare in Germany; yet we
are told in the German Ephemerides, says Brookes, that in
June, 1667, there were found about the town of Heldeshiem,
such a great number of them, that they covered all the willow-trees.
Likewise that in May, 1685, when the sky was
serene and the weather mild, a great number of Cantharides
were seen to settle upon a privet-tree, and devour all the
leaves; but they did not meddle with the flowers. We are
also told that the country people expect the return of these
insects every seven years. It is very certain, adds Brookes,
that such a number of these insects have been together in the
air, that they appeared like swarms of bees; and that they
have so disagreeable smell, that it may be perceived a great
way off, especially about sunset, though they are not seen
at that time. This bad smell is a guide for those who make

<h3 id="Tenebrionidae_Meal-worms">Tenebrionidæ&mdash;Meal-worms.</h3>

<p>The larvæ of the <i>Tenebrio molitor</i>, commonly called
Meal-worms, which are found in carious wood, are bred by
bird-fanciers, to feed nightingales, and constitute the only
bait by which these shy birds can be taken: a fact the more
curious when it is considered that the nightingale, in a state
of nature, can seldom or never see these larvæ. They are
also used to feed cameleons which are exhibited.<a id="Marker_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="marker">202</a></p>


<h3 id="Blapsidae_Church-yard_beetle_etc">Blapsidæ&mdash;Church-yard beetle, etc.</h3>

<p>We learn from Linnæus that in Sweden the appearance
of the Church-yard beetle, <i>Blaps mortisaga</i>, produces the
most violent alarm and trepidation among the people, who,
on account of its black hue and strange aspect, regard it
as the messenger of pestilence and death. Hence is this
insect called <i>mortisaga</i>&mdash;the prophesier of death.<a id="Marker_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="marker">203</a></p>

<p>A common species in Egypt, the <i>Blaps sulcata</i>, is made
into a preparation which the Egyptian women eat with the
view of acquiring what they esteem a proper degree of
plumpness! The beetle they broil and mash up in clarified
butter; then add honey, oil of sesame, and a variety of
aromatics and spices pounded together.<a id="Marker_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="marker">204</a> Fabricius reports
that the Turkish women also eat this insect, cooked with
butter, to make them fat. He also tells us that they use it
in Egypt and the Levant, as a remedy for pains and maladies
in the ears, and against the bite of scorpions.<a id="Marker_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="marker">205</a> Carsten
Niebuhr also mentions this curious practice of the women
of Turkey, and adds, the women of Arabia likewise make
use of these insects for the same purpose, taking three of
them, every morning and evening, fried in butter.<a id="Marker_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="marker">206</a></p>

<p>The Blatta mentioned by Pliny is evidently, from his description,
the Church-yard beetle, <i>Blaps mortisaga</i>, instead
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_66" title="66"></a><!--067.png-->
of the insect we now call by that name&mdash;the Cockroach:
and may very properly be here introduced. “There is
kind of fattinesse,” says this author in the words of his
translator, Philemon Holland, “to bee found in the Flie or
insect called Blatta, when the head is plucked off, which,
if it be punned and mixed with Oile of Roses, is (as they
say) wonderful good for the ears: but the wooll wherein
this medicine is enwrapped, and which is put into the ears,
must not long tarrie there, but within a little while drawne
forth againe; for the said fat will very soone get life and
prove a grub or little worme. Some writers there be who
affirme, that two or three of these flies called Blattæ sodden
in oile, make a soveraigne medicine to cure the eares, and if
they be stamped and spread upon a linen rag and so applied,
they will heale the eares, if they be hurt by any bruise
or contusion: Certes this is but a nastie and ill-favoured
vermine, howbeit in regard of the manifold and admirable
properties which naturally it hath, as also of the industrie
of our auncestours in searching out the nature of it, I am
moved to write thereof at large and to the full in this
place. For they have described many kinds of them. In
the first place, some of them be soft and tender, which
being sodden in oile, they have proved by experience to be
of great efficacie in fetching off werts, if they be annointed
therewith. A second sort there is, which they call Mylœcon,
because ordinarily it haunteth about mils and bake-houses,
and there breedeth: these by the report of <i>Musa</i>
and <i>Picton</i>, two famous Physicians, being bruised (after
their heads were gone) and applied to a bodie infected with
the leprosie, cured the same persitely. They of a third
kind, besides that they bee otherwise ill-favoured ynough,
carrie a loathsome and odious smell with them: they are
sharp rumped and pin buttockt also; howbeit, being incorporat
with the oile of pitch called Pisselæon, they have
healed those ulcers which were thought <i>nunquam sana</i>, and
incurable. Also within one and twenty daies after this plastre
laid too, it hath been knowne to cure the swelling wens
called the King’s evil: the botches or biles named Pani,
wounds, contusions, bruises, morimals, scabs, and fellons:
but then their feet and wings were plucked off and cast
away. I make no doubt or question, but that some of us
are so daintie and fine-eared, that our stomacke riseth at
the hearing onely of such medicines: and yet I assure you,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_67" title="67"></a><!--068.png-->
Diodorus, a renowned Physician, reporteth, that he has
given these foure flies inwardly with rozin and honey, for
the jaundise, and to those that were so streight-winded
that they could not draw their breath but sitting upright.
See what libertie and power over us have these Physicians,
who to practise and trie conclusions upon our bodies, may
exhibit unto their patients, what they list, be it never so
homely, so it goe under the name of a medicine.”<a id="Marker_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="marker">207</a></p>

<p>The following extraordinary case of insects introduced
into the human stomach, which is of rare occurrence, has
been completely authenticated, both by medical men and
competent naturalists. It was first published by Dr.
Pickells, of Cork, in the Dublin Transactions.<a id="Marker_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="marker">208</a></p>

<p>Mary Riordan, aged 28, had been much affected by the
death of her mother, and at one of her many visits to the
grave seems to have partially lost her senses, having been
found lying there on the morning of a winter’s day, and
having been exposed to heavy rain during the night. It
appears that when she was about fifteen, two popular
Catholic priests had died, and she was told by some old
woman, that if she would drink daily, for a certain time, a
quantity of water, mixed with clay taken from their graves,
she would be forever secure from disease and sin. So following
this absurd and disgusting prescription, she took
from time to time large quantities of the draught; and,
some time afterward, being affected with a burning pain in
the stomach (<i>cardialgia</i>), she began to eat large pieces of
chalk, which she sometimes also mixed with water and
drank. In all these draughts, it is most probable, she
swallowed the eggs of the enormous progenies of apterous,
dipterous, and coleopterous insects, which she for several
years continued to throw up alive and moving. Dr. Pickells
asserts that altogether he himself saw nearly 2000 of these
larvæ, and that there were many he did not see, for, to avoid
publicity, she herself destroyed a great number, and many,
too, escaped immediately by running into holes in the floor.
Of this incredible number, the greatest proportion were
larvæ of the Church-yard beetle, <i>Blaps mortisaga</i>, and of
a dipterous insect, an <i>Ascarides;</i> and two were specimens
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_68" title="68"></a><!--069.png-->
of the Meal-worm&mdash;the larvæ of the Darkling&mdash;<i>Tenebrio
molitor</i>. It may be interesting to learn that, by means of
turpentine in large doses, this unfortunate woman was at
length entirely rid of her pests.<a id="Marker_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="marker">209</a></p>


<h3 id="Curculionidae_Weevils">Curculionidæ&mdash;Weevils.</h3>

<p>At Rio Janeiro, the brilliant Diamond-beetle, <i>Eutimis
nobilis</i>, is in great request for brooches for gentlemen, and
ten piasters are often paid for a single specimen. In this
city many owners send their slaves out to catch insects, so
that now the rarest and most brilliant species are to be had
at a comparatively trifling sum. Each of these slaves, when
he has attained to some adroitness in this operation, may,
on a fine day, catch in the vicinity of the city as many as
five or six hundred beetles. So this trade is considered
there very lucrative, since six milresis (four rix dollars, or
about fourteen shillings) are paid for the hundred. For
these splendid insects there is a general demand; and their
wing-cases are now sought for the purpose of adorning the
ladies of Europe&mdash;a fashion, it is said, which threatens the
entire extinction of this beautiful tribe.<a id="Marker_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="marker">210</a></p>

<p>Messrs. Kidder and Fletcher tell us that in Brazil “a
commerce is carried on in artificial flowers made from
beetles’ wings, fish-scales, sea-shells, and feathers, which
attract the attention of every visitor. These are made,”
they continue, “by the <i>mulheres</i> (women) of almost every
class, and thus they obtain not only pin-money, but some
amass wealth in the traffic.”<a id="Marker_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="marker">211</a> Among the beetles referred
to by these gentlemen may be placed no doubt the
<i>Eutimis nobilis</i>.</p>

<p>Among the largest of the species of this family is the
Palm-weevil, <i>Calandra palmarum</i>, which is of an uniform
black color, and measures more than two inches in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_69" title="69"></a><!--070.png-->
length. Its larva, called the <i>Grou-grou</i>,<a id="Marker_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="marker">212</a> or Cabbage-tree
worm, which is very large, white, of an oval shape, resides
in the tenderest part of the smaller palm-trees, and is considered,
fried or broiled, as one of the greatest dainties in
the West Indies. “The tree,” says Madame Merian,
“grows to the height of a man, and is cut off when it begins
to be tender, is cooked like a cauliflower, and tastes
better than an artichoke. In the middle of these trees live
innumerable quantities of worms, which at first are as small
as a maggot in a nut, but afterward grow to a very large
size, and feed on the marrow of the tree. These worms
are laid on the coals to roast, and are considered as a
highly agreeable food.”<a id="Marker_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="marker">213</a> Capt. Stedman tells us these
larvæ are a delicious treat to many people, and that they
are regularly sold at Paramaribo. He mentions, too, the
manner of dressing them, which is by frying them in a pan
with a very little butter and salt, or spitting them on a
wooden skewer; and, that thus prepared, in taste they partake
of all the spices of India&mdash;mace, cinnamon, cloves, nutmegs,
etc.<a id="Marker_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="marker">214</a> This gentleman also says he once found concealed
near the trunk of an old tree a “case-bottle filled
with excellent butter,” which the rangers told him the natives
made by melting and clarifying the fat of this larva.<a id="Marker_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="marker">215</a>
Dr. Winterbottom states this grub is served up at all the
luxurious tables of West Indian epicures, particularly of the
French, as the greatest dainty of the western world.<a id="Marker_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="marker">216</a></p>

<p>Dobrizhoffer doubtless refers to the larva of the <i>Calandra
palmarum</i>, when he says: “The Spaniards of Santiago in
Tucuman, when they go seeking honey in the woods, cleave
certain palm-trees upon their way, and on their return find
large grubs in the wounded trees, which they fry as a delicious
food.”<a id="Marker_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="marker">217</a> The same is said of the Guaraunos of the
Orinoco&mdash;“that they find these grubs in great numbers in
the palms, which they cut down for the sake of their juice.
After all has been drawn out that will flow, these grubs
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_70" title="70"></a><!--071.png-->
breed in the incisions, and the trunk produces, as it were, a
second crop.”<a id="Marker_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="marker">218</a></p>

<p>The Creoles of the Island of Barbados, says Schomburgk,
consider the Grou-grou worm a great delicacy when
roasted, and say it resembles in taste the marrow of beef-bones.<a id="Marker_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="marker">219</a></p>

<p>Antonio de Ulloa, in his <i>Noticias Americanas</i>, says this
grub has the singular property of producing milk in women.<a id="Marker_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="marker">220</a>
The Argentina, the historic poem of Brazil, adds an assertion
which is more certainly fabulous, viz., that they first
become butterflies, and then mice.<a id="Marker_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="marker">221</a></p>

<p>They have a similar dainty in Java in the larva of some
large beetle, which the natives call <i>Moutouke</i>.&mdash;“A thick,
white maggot which lives in wood, and so eats it away, that
the backs of chairs, and feet of drawers, although apparently
sound, are frequently rotten within, and fall into dust
when it is least expected. This creature may sometimes
be heard at work. It is as big as a silk-worm, and very
white, … a mere lump of fat. Thirty are roasted
together threaded on a little stick, and are delicate eating.”<a id="Marker_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="marker">222</a></p>

<p>Ælian speaks of an Indian king, who, for a dessert, instead
of fruit set before his Grecian guests a roasted worm
taken from a plant, probably the larva of the <i>Calandra palmarum</i>,
a native of Persia and Mesopotamia as well as of
the West Indies, which he says the Indians esteemed very
delicious&mdash;a character that was confirmed by some of the
Greeks who tasted it.<a id="Marker_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="marker">223</a></p>

<p>The trunk of the grass-tree, or black-boy, <i>Xanthorea
arborea</i>, when beginning to decay, furnishes large quantities
of marrow-like grubs, which are considered a delicacy by
the aborigines of Western Australia. They have a fragrant,
aromatic flavor, and form a favorite food among the natives,
either raw or roasted. They call them <i>Bardi</i>. They are
also found in the wattle-tree, or mimosa. The presence of
these grubs in the <i>Xanthorea</i> is thus ascertained: if the top
of one of these trees is observed to be dead, and it contain
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_71" title="71"></a><!--072.png-->
any bardi, a few sharp kicks given to it with the foot will
cause it to crack and shake, when it is pushed over and the
grubs taken out, by breaking the tree to pieces with a hammer.
The bardi of the Xanthorea are small, and found
together in great numbers; those of the wattle are cream-colored,
as long and thick as a man’s finger, and are found
singly.<a id="Marker_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="marker">224</a></p>

<p>Dr. Livingstone states that in the valley of Quango, S.
Africa, the natives dig large white larvæ out of the damp
soil adjacent to their streams, and use them as a relish to
their vegetable diet.<a id="Marker_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="marker">225</a></p>

<p>In the latter part of the eighteenth century, there was
published at Florence, by Prof. Gergi, the history of a remarkable
insect which he names <i>Curculio anti-odontalgicus</i>.
This insect, as he assures us, not only in the name he has
given it, but also in an account of the many cures effected
by it, is endowed with the singular property of curing the
toothache. He tells us, that if fourteen or fifteen of the
larvæ be rubbed between the thumb and fore-finger, till the
fluid is absorbed, and if a carious aching tooth be but
touched with the thumb or finger thus prepared, the pain
will be removed; a finger thus prepared, he says in conclusion,
will, unless it be used for tooth-touching, retain its
virtue for a year! This remarkable insect is only found on
a nondescript plant, the <i>Carduus spinosis-simus</i>.<a id="Marker_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="marker">226</a></p>

<p>It is said, also by Prof. Gergi, that the Tuscan peasants
have long been acquainted with several insects which furnish
a charm for the toothache, as the <i>Curculio jæcac</i>, <i>C.
Bacchus</i>, and <i>Carabus chrysocephalus</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>The curious facts contained in the following quotation,
from Chambers’ Book of Days, were among the first that
led me to attempt the present compilation. The scientific
name of the insect here mentioned is, in the opinion of
Prof. Gill and other scientists, a misprint for <i>Rhynchitus
auratus</i>, and, following this decision, I have here placed it
under the <i>Curculionidæ</i>.&mdash;“A lawsuit between the inhabitants
of the Commune of St. Julien and a coleopterous insect,
now known to naturalists as the <i>Eynchitus aureus</i>,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_72" title="72"></a><!--073.png-->
lasted for more than forty-two years. At length the inhabitants
proposed to compromise the matter by giving up, in
perpetuity, to the insects, a fertile part of the district for
their sole use and benefit. Of course the advocate of the
animals demurred to the proposition, but the court, overruling
the demurrer, appointed assessors to survey the land,
and, it proving to be well wooded and watered, and every
way suitable for the insects, ordered the conveyance to be
engrossed in due form and executed. The unfortunate
people then thought they had got rid of a trouble imposed
upon them by their litigious fathers and grandfathers; but
they were sadly mistaken. It was discovered that there had
formerly been a mine or quarry of an ochreous earth, used
as a pigment, in the land conveyed to the insects, and though
the quarry had long since been worked out and exhausted,
some one possessed an ancient right of way to it, which if
exercised would be greatly to the annoyance of the new proprietors.
Consequently the contract was vitiated, and the
whole process commenced <i>de novo</i>. How or when it ended,
the mutilation of the recording documents prevents us
from knowing; but it is certain that the proceedings commenced
in the year 1445, and that they had not concluded
in 1487. So what with the insects, the lawyers, and the
church, the poor inhabitants must have been pretty well
fleeced. During the whole period of a process, religious
processions and other expensive ceremonies that had to be
well paid for, were strictly enjoined. Besides, no district
could commence a process of this kind unless all its arrears
of tithes were paid up; and this circumstance gave rise to
the well-known French legal maxim&mdash;‘The first step toward
getting rid of locusts is the payment of tithes?’ an adage
that in all probability was susceptible of more meanings
than one.”<a id="Marker_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="marker">227</a></p>


<h3 id="Cerambycidae_Musk-beetles">Cerambycidæ&mdash;Musk-beetles.</h3>

<p>Moufet says: “The Cerambyx, knowing that his legs

so he hangs at ease.… They thrust upon us some

German fables, as many as say it flies only, and when it is
weary it falls to the earth and presently dies. Those that
are slaves to tales, render this reason for it: Terambus, a
satyrist, did not abstain from quipping of the Muses, whereupon
they transformed him into a beetle called Cerambyx,
and that deservedly, to endure a double punishment, for he
hath legs weak that he goes lame, and like a thief he hangs
on a tree. Antonius Libealis, lib. i. of his Metamorphosis,
relates the matter in these words: The Muses in anger
transformed Terambus because he reproached them, and he
was made a Cerambyx that feeds on wood,” etc.<a id="Marker_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="marker">228</a></p>

<p>A large species of longicorn beetles, the <i>Acanthocinus
ædilis</i>, is the well-known <i>Timerman</i> of Sweden and Lapland;
an insect which the natives of these countries regard
with a kind of superstitious veneration. Its presence is
thought to be the presage of good fortune, and it is as carefully
protected and cherished as storks are by the peasantry
of the Low Countries.<a id="Marker_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="marker">229</a></p>

<p>It has been found that the common cinnamon-colored
Musk-beetle, <i>Cerambyx moschatus</i>, when dried and reduced
to powder, and made use of as a vesicatory, in the
manner of the officinal Cantharides, produces a similar
effect, and in as short a space of time.<a id="Marker_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="marker">230</a></p>

<p>The <i>Prionus damicornis</i> is a native of many parts of
America and the West Indies, where its larva, a grub about
three and a half inches in length, and of the thickness of
the little finger, is in great request as an article of food,
being considered by epicures as one of the greatest delicacies
of the New World. We are informed by authors of
the highest respectability, that some people of fortune in the
West Indies keep negroes for the sole purpose of going into
the woods in quest of these admired larvæ, who scoop them
out of the trees in which they reside. Dr. Browne, in his
History of Jamaica, informs us that they are chiefly found
in the plum and silk-cotton trees (<i>Bombax</i>). They are
commonly called by the name of <i>Macauco</i>, or <i>Macokkos</i>.
The mode of dressing them is first to open and wash
them, and then carefully broil them over a charcoal fire.<a id="Marker_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="marker">231</a>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_74" title="74"></a><!--075.png-->
Sir Hans Sloane tells us the Indians of Jamaica boil them
in their soups, pottages, olios, and pepper-pots, and account
them of delicious flavor, much like, but preferable to, marrow;
and the negroes of this island roast them slightly at
the fire, and eat them with bread.<a id="Marker_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="marker">232</a></p>

<p>A similar larva is dressed at Mauritius under the name of
<i>Moutac</i>, which the whites as well as the negroes eat greedily.<a id="Marker_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="marker">233</a>
According to Linnæus, the larva of the <i>Prionus cervicornis</i>
is held in equal estimation; and that of the <i>Acanthocinus
tribulus</i> when roasted forms an article of food in
Africa.<a id="Marker_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="marker">234</a></p>

<p>The <i>Cossus</i> of Pliny belonged most probably to this
tribe, or to the <i>Lucanidæ</i>.</p>


<hr />

<p>Wanley knew a nun in the monastery of St. Clare, who
at the sight of a beetle was affected in the following strange
manner. It happened that some young girls, knowing her
disposition, threw a beetle into her bosom, which when she
perceived, she immediately fell into a swoon, deprived of all
sense, and remained four hours in cold sweats. She did not
regain her strength for many days after, but continued trembling
and pale.<a id="Marker_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="marker">235</a></p>


<h3 id="Galerucidae_Turnip-fly_etc">Galerucidæ&mdash;Turnip-fly, etc.</h3>

<p>The striped Turnip-beetle, <i>Haltica nemorum</i>, commonly
called the <i>Turnip-fly</i>, <i>Turnip-flea</i>, <i>Earth-flea-beetle</i>,
<i>Black-jack</i>, etc., is a well known species from the
ravages the perfect insect commits upon the turnip. In
Devonshire, England, in the year 1786, the loss caused by
these insects alone was valued at £100,000 sterling. And
in the spring of 1837, the vines in the neighborhood of
Montpellier were attacked to so great an extent by another
species, <i>Haltica oleracea</i>, in the perfect state, that fears
were entertained for the plants, and religious processions
were instituted for the purpose of exorcising the insects.<a id="Marker_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="marker">236</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_75" title="75"></a><!--076.png-->

<h3 id="Forficulidae_Ear-wigs">Forficulidæ&mdash;Ear-wigs.</h3>

<p>The vulgar opinion that the Ear-wig, <i>Forficula auricularia</i>,
seeks to introduce itself into the ear of human beings,
and causes much injury to that organ, is very ancient, but
not founded on fact, for they are perfectly harmless. To
this opinion the names of this insect in almost all European
languages point: as in English, <i>Ear-wig</i> (from Anglo-Saxon
<i>eare</i>, the ear, and <i>wigga</i>, a worm; hence, also, our word
<i>wiggle</i>), in French, <i>Perce-oreille</i>, and in the German, <i>Ohrwurm</i>.
But, according to some writers, these names arose
from the shape of the wing when expanded, which then resembles
the human ear; and <i>ear-wig</i> might easily be a corruption
of ear-<em>wing</em>.</p>

<p>Swift, in the following lines, introduces an “Ear-wig
(probably a <i>Curculio</i>) in a plum,” as though in allusion to
some superstition:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Doll never flies to cut her lace,</div>
<div class="line">Or throw cold water in her face,</div>
<div class="line">Because she heard a sudden drum,</div>
<div class="line">Or found an ear-wig in a plum.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oil of Ear-wigs,” says Dr. James, “is good to strengthen
the nerves under convulsive motions, by rubbing it on the
temples, wrists, and nostrils. These insects, being dried,
pulverized, and mixed with the urine of a hare, are esteemed
to be good for deafness, being introduced into the ear.”<a id="Marker_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="marker">240</a></p>

<p>In August, 1755, in the parishes adjacent to Stroud, it is said
there were such quantities of Ear-wigs, that they destroyed
not only the fruits and flowers, but the cabbages, though of
full growth. The houses, especially the old wooden buildings,
were swarming with them: the cracks and crevices
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_77" title="77"></a><!--078.png-->
surprisingly full, so that they dropped out oftentimes in
such multitudes as to literally cover the floor. Linen, of
which they are fond, was likewise full, as was the furniture;
and it was with caution any provisions could be eaten, for
the cupboards and safes flocked with these little pests.<a id="Marker_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="marker">241</a></p>

into the ears, eases the pains thereof.”<a id="Marker_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="marker">243</a> It is most probable
the insect now called Blatta is not at all meant by either of
the above gentlemen. The Blatta of Dioscorides is quite
likely the Blatta of Pliny, which has been with good reason
conjectured to be the modern <i>Blaps mortisaga</i>&mdash;the common
Church-yard beetle.</p>

<p>In England, the hedge-hog, <i>Erinaceus Europæus</i>,
from its fondness for insects and its nocturnal habits, is
often kept domesticated in kitchens to destroy the Cockroaches
with which they are infested; and the housekeepers
of Jamaica, as we are informed by Sir Hans Sloane, for the
same reasons and purpose, keep large spiders in their
houses.<a id="Marker_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="marker">244</a> A species of monkey, <i>Simia jacchus</i>, and a
species of lemur, <i>L. tardigradus</i>, are also made use of for
destroying these insects, especially on board ships.<a id="Marker_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="marker">245</a> Mr.
Neill, in the Magazine of Natural History, in his account
of the above-mentioned species of monkey, says: “By chance
we observed it devouring a large Cockroach, which it had
caught running along the deck of the vessel; and, from this
time to nearly the end of the voyage, a space of four or five
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_79" title="79"></a><!--080.png-->
weeks, it fed almost exclusively on these insects, and contributed
most effectually to rid the vessel of them. It frequently
ate a score of the largest kind, which are from two
to two and a half inches long, and a very great number of
the smaller ones, three or four times in the course of the
day. It was quite amusing to see it at its meal. When
he had got hold of one of the largest Cockroaches, he held
it in his fore-paws, and then invariably nipped the head off
first; he then pulled out the viscera and cast them aside,
and devoured the rest of the body, rejecting the dry elytra
and wings, and also the legs of the insect, which are covered
with short stiff bristles. The small Cockroaches he ate
without such fastidious nicety.”<a id="Marker_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="marker">246</a></p>

<p>The common Cockroach, or Black-beetle, as it is sometimes
vulgarly called, the <i>Blatta orientalis</i>, is said originally
to be a native of India, and introduced here, as well
as in every other part of the civilized globe, through the
medium of commerce. In England, another species, said
to be a native of America, <i>Blatta Americana</i>, larger than
the last, is now also becoming very common, especially in
seaport towns where merchandise is stored.<a id="Marker_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="marker">247</a></p>

<p>An old Swede, Luen Laock, one of the first Swedish
clergymen that came to Pennsylvania, told the traveler
Kalm, that in his younger days, he had once been very
much frightened by a Cockroach, which crept into his ear
while he was asleep. Waking suddenly, he jumped out of
bed, which caused the insect, most probably out of fear, to
strive with all its strength to get deeper into his skull, producing
such excruciating pain that he imagined his head
was bursting, and he almost fell senseless to the floor.
Hastening, however, to the well, he drew a bucket of water,
and threw some in his ear. The Roach then finding itself
in danger of being drowned, quickly pushed out backward,
and as quickly delivered the poor Swede from his pain and
fears.<a id="Marker_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="marker">248</a></p>

<p>The proverbial expression “Sound as a Roach” is supposed
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_80" title="80"></a><!--081.png-->
to have been derived from familiarity with the legend
and attributes of the Saint Roche,&mdash;the esteemed saint of
all afflicted with the plague, a disease of common occurrence
in England when the streets were narrow, and without
sewers, houses without boarded floors, and our ancestors
without linen. They believed that the miraculous St.
Roche could make them as “sound” as himself.<a id="Marker_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="marker">249</a></p>

<p>A quite common superstitious practice, in order to rid a
house of Cockroaches, is in vogue in our country at the
present time. It is no other than to address these pests a
written letter containing the following words, or to this
effect: “O, Roaches, you have troubled me long enough,
go now and trouble my neighbors.” This letter must be
put where they most swarm, after sealing and going through
with the other customary forms of letter writing. It is
well, too, to write legibly and punctuate according to rule.</p>

<p>Another receipt for driving away Cockroaches is as follows:
Close in an envelope several of these insects, and
drop it in the street unseen, and the remaining Roaches will
all go to the finder of the parcel.</p>

<p>It is also said that if a looking-glass be held before
Roaches, they will be so frightened as to leave the premises.</p>

<p>A firm, which has been established in London for seven
years, and which manufactures exclusively poison known
to the trade as the “Phosphor Paste for the Destruction of
Black-beetles, Cockroaches, rats, mice,” etc., has given to
Mr. Mayhew the following information:</p>

<p>“We have now sold this vermin poison for seven years,
but we have never had an application for our composition
from any street-seller. We have seen, a year or two since,
a man about London who used to sell beetle-wafers; but
as we knew that kind of article to be entirely useless, we
were not surprised to find that he did not succeed in making
a living. We have not heard of him for some time, and
have no doubt he is dead, or has taken up some other line
of employment.</p>

<p>“It is a strange fact, perhaps; but we do not know anything,
or scarcely anything, as to the kind of people and
tradesmen who purchase our poison&mdash;to speak the truth, we
do not like to make too many inquiries of our customers.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_81" title="81"></a><!--082.png-->
Sometimes, when they have used more than their customary
quantity, we have asked, casually, how it was and to
what kind of business people they disposed of it, and we
have always met with an evasive sort of answer. You see
tradesmen don’t like to divulge too much; for it must be a
poor kind of profession or calling that there are no secrets
in; and, again, they fancy we want to know what description
of trades use the most of our composition, so that we
might supply them direct from ourselves. From this cause
we have made a rule not to inquire curiously into the matters
of our customers. We are quite content to dispose of
the quantity we do, for we employ six travelers to call on
chemists and oilmen for the town trade, and four for the
country.</p>

<p>“The other day an elderly lady from High Street, Camden
Town, called upon us: she stated that she was overrun
with black beetles, and wished to buy some of our
paste from ourselves, for she said she always found things
better if you purchased them of the maker, as you were
sure to get them stronger, and by that means avoided the
adulteration of the shopkeepers. But as we have said we
would not supply a single box to any one, not wishing to
give our agents any cause for complaint, we were obliged
to refuse to sell to the old lady.</p>

<p>“We don’t care to say how many boxes we sell in the
year; but we can tell you, sir, that we sell more for beetle
poisoning in the summer than in the winter, as a matter of
course. When we find that a particular district uses almost
an equal quantity all the year round, we make sure that
that is a rat district; for where there is not the heat of
summer to breed beetles, it must follow that the people
wish to get rid of rats.</p>

<p>“Brixton, Hackney, Ball’s Pond, and Lower Road, Islington,
are the places that use most of our paste, those
districts lying low, and being consequently damp. Camden
Town, though it is in a high situation, is very much infested
with beetles; it is a clayey soil, you understand, which retains
moisture, and will not allow it to filter through like
gravel. This is why in some very low districts, where the
houses are built on gravel, we sell scarcely any of our
paste.</p>

<p>“As the farmers say, a good fruit year is a good fly
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_82" title="82"></a><!--083.png-->
year; so we say, a good dull, wet summer, is a good beetle
summer; and this has been a very fertile year, and we only
hope it will be as good next year.</p>

<p>“We don’t believe in rat-destroyers; they profess to kill
with weasels and a lot of things, and sometimes even say
they can charm them away. Captains of vessels, when
they arrive in the docks, will employ these people; and, as
we say, they generally use our composition, but as long as
their vessels are cleared of the vermin, they don’t care to
know how it is done. A man who drives about in a cart,
and does a great business in this way, we have reason to
believe uses a great quantity of our Phosphor Paste. He
comes from somewhere down the East-end or Whitechapel
way.</p>

<p>“Our prices are too high for the street-sellers. Your
street-seller can only afford to sell an article made by a
person in but a very little better position than himself.
Even our small boxes cost at the trade price two shillings
a dozen, and when sold will only produce three shillings;
so you can imagine the profit is not enough for the itinerant
vendor.</p>

<p>“Bakers don’t use much of our paste, for they seem to
think it no use to destroy the vermin&mdash;beetles and bakers’
shops generally go together.”<a id="Marker_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="marker">250</a></p>

<p>If a black beetle enters your room, or flies against you,
severe illness and perhaps death will soon follow. I have
never heard this superstition but in Maryland.</p>


<h3 id="Mantidae_Soothsayers_etc">Mantidæ&mdash;Soothsayers, etc.</h3>

<p>We now come to a very extraordinary family of insects,
the <i>Mantidæ</i>. “Imagination itself,” as Dr. Shaw well observes,
“can hardly conceive shapes more strange than those
exhibited by some particular species.”<a id="Marker_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="marker">251</a> “They are called
<i>Mantes;</i> that is, fortune-tellers,” says Mouffet, “either because
by their coming (for they first of all appear) they do
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_83" title="83"></a><!--084.png-->
show the spring to be at hand, as Anacreon, the poet, sang;
or else they foretell death and famine, as Cælias, the scholiast
of Theocritus, writes; or, lastly, because it always holds up
its fore-feet, like hands, praying, as it were, after the manner
of their divines, who in that gesture did pour out their
supplications to their gods. So divine a creature is this
esteemed, that if a childe aske the way to such a place, she
will stretch out one of her feet and show him the right way,
and seldome or never misse. As she resembleth those diviners
in the elevation of her hands, so also in likeness of
motion, for they do not sport themselves as others do, nor
leap, nor play, but walking softly she returns her modesty,
and showes forth a kind of mature gravity.”<a id="Marker_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="marker">252</a></p>

<p>The name <i>Mantis</i> is of Greek origin, and signifies diviner.
In one of the Idylls of Theocritus, however, it is
employed to designate a thin, young girl, with slender and
elongated arms. <i>Præmacram ac pertenuem puellam μαντιν.
Corpore prælongo, pedibus etiam prælongis, locustæ genus.</i></p>

<p>These insects, <i>Mantis oratoria</i>, <i>religiosa</i>, etc., in consequence
of their having, as Mouffet says, their fore-feet extended
as if they were praying, are called in France, <i>Devin</i>,
and <i>Prega-diou</i> or <i>Prêche-dieu;</i> and with us, <i>Praying-insects</i>,
<i>Soothsayers</i>, and <i>Diviners</i>. They are also often
called from their singular shape <i>Camel-crickets</i>.</p>

<p>The Mantis was observed by the Greeks in soothsaying;<a id="Marker_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="marker">253</a>
and the Hindoos displayed the same reverential consideration
of its movements and flight.<a id="Marker_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="marker">254</a></p>

<p>But, in modern times, the superstition respecting the
sanctity of the Mantis begins in Southern Europe, and is
found in almost every other quarter of the globe, at least
wherever a characteristic species of the insect is found.</p>

<p>In the southern provinces of France, where the Mantis
is very abundant, both the characters of praying and pointing
out the lost way, as above mentioned by Mouffet, are
still ascribed to it by the peasantry, as is evidenced by the
above mentioned names they know them by. And here, as
wherever else this superstition obtains, it is considered a
great crime to injure the Mantis, and as, at least, a very
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_84" title="84"></a><!--085.png-->
culpable neglect not to place it out of the way of any danger
to which it seems exposed.</p>

<p>The Turks and other Moslems have been much impressed
by the actions of the common Mantis, the <i>religiosa</i>,<a id="Marker_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="marker">255</a> which
greatly resemble some of their own attitudes of prayer.
They readily recognize intelligence and pious intentions in
its actions, and accordingly treat it with respect and attention,
not indeed as in itself an object of reverence or superstition,
but as a fellow-worshiper of God, whom they believe
that all creatures praise, with more or less consciousness
and intelligence.<a id="Marker_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="marker">256</a></p>

<p>But it is in Africa, and especially in Southern Africa,
that the Mantis (here the <i>Mantis causta</i>)<a id="Marker_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="marker">257</a> receives its highest
honors. The attention of the travelers and missionaries
in that quarter was necessarily much drawn to the kind
of religious veneration paid to an insect, and from their
accounts, though very contradictory, some curious information
may be collected.</p>

<p>The authority of Peter Kolben, an early German traveler
to the Cape of Good Hope, is as follows: That the Hottentots
regard as a good deity an insect of the “beetle-kind”
peculiar to their country. This “beetle-god” is described
by him to be “about the size of a child’s little finger, the
back green, the belly speckled white and red, with two
wings and two horns.” He also assures us that whenever
the Hottentots meet this insect, they pay it the highest
honor and veneration; and that if it visits a kraal they
assemble about it as if a divinity had descended among
them; and even kill a sheep or two as a thank-offering, and
esteem it an omen of the greatest happiness and prosperity.
They believe, also, its appearance expiates all their guilt;
and if the insect lights upon one of them, such person is
looked upon as a saint, be it man or woman, and ever after
treated with uncommon respect. The kraal then kills the
fattest ox for a thank-offering; and the caul, powdered with
<i>bukhu</i>, and twisted like a rope, is put on, like a collar, about
the neck, and there must remain till it rots off.<a id="Marker_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="marker">258</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_85" title="85"></a><!--086.png-->

<p>Kolben, in another place, describes the Mantis under the
name of the <i>Gold-beetle</i>, saying that its head and wings are
of a gold color, the back green, etc., as above.<a id="Marker_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="marker">259</a></p>

<p>Mr. Kolben, again speaking of this singular reverence,
remarks that the Hottentots will run every hazard to secure
the safety of this fortunate insect, and are cautious to the
last degree of giving it the slightest annoyance, and relates
the following anecdote:</p>

<p>“A German, who had a country-seat about six miles from
the fort, having given leave to some Hottentots to turn their
cattle for awhile upon his land there, they removed to the
place with their <i>kraal</i>. A son of this German, a brisk
young fellow, was amusing himself in the kraal, when the
deified insect appeared. The Hottentots, upon sight, ran
tumultuously to adore it; while the young fellow tried to
catch it, in order to see the effect such capture would produce
among them. But how great was the general cry and
agony when they saw it in his hands! They stared with
distraction in their eyes at him, and at one another. ‘See,
see, see,’ said they. ‘Ah! what is he going to do? Will
he kill it? will he kill it?’ Every limb of them shaking
through apprehensions for its fate. ‘Why,’ said the young
fellow, who very well understood them, ‘do you make such
a hideous noise? and why such agonies for this paltry animal?’
‘Ah! sir,’ they replied, with the utmost concern,
‘’tis a divinity. ’Tis come from heaven; ’tis come on a
good design. Ah! do not hurt it&mdash;do not offend it. We
are the most miserable wretches upon earth if you do. This
ground will be under a curse, and the crime will never be
forgiven.’ This was not enough for the young German.
He had a mind to carry the experiment a little farther. He
seemed not, therefore, to be moved with their petitions and
remonstrances; but made as if he intended to maim or destroy
it. On this appearance of cruelty they started, and
ran to and again like people frantic; asked him, where and
what his conscience was? and how he durst think of perpetrating
a crime, which would bring upon his head all the
curses and thunders of heaven. But this not prevailing,
they fell all prostrate on the ground before the young fellow,
and with streaming eyes and the loudest cries, besought
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_86" title="86"></a><!--087.png-->
him to spare the creature and give it its liberty. The young
German now yielded, and, having let the insect fly, the Hottentots
jumped and capered and shouted in all the transports
of joy; and, running after the animal, rendered it the
customary divine honors. But the creature settled upon none
of them, and there was not one sainted upon this occasion.”<a id="Marker_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="marker">260</a></p>

<p>Afterward, Mr. Kolben, discoursing with these Hottentots,
took occasion to ask them concerning the utmost limit they
carried the belief of the sanctity and avenging spirit of this
insect, when they declared to him, that if the German had
killed it, all their cattle would certainly have been destroyed
by wild beasts, and they themselves, every man, woman, and
child of them, brought to a miserable end. That they
believed the kraal to be of evil destiny where this insect is
rarely seen. Mr. Kolben asserts that they would sooner
give up their lives than renounce the slightest item of their
belief.<a id="Marker_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="marker">261</a></p>

<p>Dr. Sparrman, a Swedish traveler into the country of the
Hottentots and Caffres between the years 1772 and 1779, in
speaking of the Mantis, called in his time the “Hottentot’s
God,” denies the above statement of Mr. Kolben, and says
the Hottentots are so far from worshiping it, that they several
times caught some of them, and gave them to him to
put needles through them, by way of preserving them, in the
same manner as he did with the other insects. But there is,
he adds, a diminutive species of this insect, which some think
would be a crime, as well as very dangerous, to do any
harm to, but that it was only a superstitious notion, and
not any kind of religious worship.<a id="Marker_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="marker">262</a></p>

<p>Dr. Thunberg, who traveled in South Africa about the
same time as Dr. Sparrman, corroborates the latter’s statement,
and says he could see no reason for the supposition
that the Hottentots worshiped the Mantis, but, he adds, it
certainly was held in some degree of esteem, so that they
would not willingly hurt, and deemed that person a creature
fortunate on which it settled, though without paying it any
sort of adoration.<a id="Marker_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="marker">263</a></p>

<p>Dr. Vanderkemp, in his account of Caffraria, after describing
the Mantis, says that the natives call it <i>oumtoanizoulou</i>,
the <i>Child of Heaven</i>, and adds that “the Hottentots
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_87" title="87"></a><!--088.png-->
regard it as almost a deity, and offer their prayers to
it, begging that it may not destroy them.”<a id="Marker_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="marker">264</a></p>

<p>Mr. Kirchener, speaking of the same people, says they
reverence a little insect, known by the name of the <i>Creeping
Leaf</i>, a sight of which they conceive indicates something
fortunate, and to kill it they suppose will bring a curse upon
the perpetrator.<a id="Marker_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="marker">265</a></p>

<p>Mr. Evan Evans, a missionary to the Cape of Good
Hope, gives an account of a conversation which he had with
the Hottentot driver of his wagon, which seems to make out
the claims of the Mantis to be the God of the Hottentots&mdash;as
it is even yet called. The driver directed his attention to
“a small insect,” which he called by its above-mentioned
familiar name, and alluded to the notions he had in former
times connected with it. “I asked him, ‘Did you ever
worship this insect then?’ He answered, ‘Oh, yes! a thousand
times; always before I came to Bethelsdorf. Whenever
I saw this little creature, I would fall down on my
knees before him and pray.’ ‘What did you pray to him
for?’ ‘I asked him to give me a good master, and plenty
of thick milk and flesh.’ ‘Did you pray for nothing else?’
‘No, sir; I did not then know that I wanted anything else.…
Whenever I used to see this animal (holding the
insect still in his hand) I used sometimes to fall down immediately
before it; but if it was in the wagon-road, or in
a foot-path, I used to push it up as gently as I could, to
place it behind a bush, for fear a wagon should crush it, or
some men or beasts would put it to death. If a Hottentot,
by some accident, killed or injured this creature, he was sure
to be unlucky all his lifetime, and could never shoot an elephant
or a buffalo afterward.’”<a id="Marker_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="marker">266</a></p>

<p>Niuhoff, in his account of his travels in Java in 1643,
tells us “the Javanese set two of these little creatures
(Mantes) a fighting together, and lay money on both sides,
as we do at a cock-match.”<a id="Marker_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="marker">267</a> Among the Chinese also this
quarrelsome property in the genus Mantis is turned into an
entertainment. They are so fond of gaming and witnessing
fights between animals that, as says Mr. Barrow in his
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_88" title="88"></a><!--089.png-->
Travels, “they have even extended their inquiries after
fighting animals into the insect tribe, and have discovered a
species of Gryllus or Locust that will attack each other with
such ferocity as seldom to quit their hold without bringing
away at the same time a limb of their antagonist. These
little creatures are fed and kept apart in bamboo cages, and
the custom of making them devour each other is so common
that, during the summer months, scarcely a boy is to be
seen without his cage of grasshoppers.”<a id="Marker_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="marker">268</a> The boys in
Washington City, who call the Mantis the “Rear-horse,”
are also fond of this amusement.</p>

<p>Among the legends of St. Francis Xavier, the following
is found. Seeing a Mantis moving along in its solemn way,
holding up its two fore-legs, as in the act of devotion, the
Saint desired it to sing the praises of God, whereupon the
insect caroled forth a fine canticle.<a id="Marker_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="marker">269</a></p>

<p>The <i>Mantis religiosa</i> of America is said to make a most
interesting pet when tamed, which can be done in a very
short time and with but little pains. Professor Glover, of
the Maryland Agricultural College, tells me he once knew a
lady in Washington who kept a Mantis on her window
which soon grew so tame as to take readily a fly or other
small insect out of her hand. But Mrs. Taylor, in her Orthopterian
Defense, has given us the particulars in full of a
Mantis which she had petted. She speaks of it under the
name of “Queen Bess,” and in her most interesting style, as
follows:</p>

<p>“Queen Bess, of famous memory, would alight on my
shoulder and take all her food from me half a dozen times
a day. When she omitted her visit I knew she had been
hunting on her own account. All night long she would
keep watch and guard under the mosquito-net. The silk
(the thread with which the insect was bound) was fastened
to the post of the bed; and woe betide an unfortunate mosquito
who fancied for his supper a drop of claret. It was
the drollest, the most laughter-moving sensation, to feel one
of these trumpeters saluting your nose or forehead, and
hear Queen Bess approaching with those long claws, creeping
slowly, softly, nearer and nearer; to feel the fine prick
of the lancet setting in for a tipple; then you would suppose
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_89" title="89"></a><!--090.png-->
a dozen fine needles had been suddenly drawn across
the part; then, <i>presto!</i> Bess’s strong, saber-like claws had
the jolly trumpeter tucked into her capacious jaws before
you could open your eyes to ascertain the state of affairs.</p>

<p>“These creatures very seldom fly far,” continues Mrs.
Taylor, “but walk in a most stately and dignified manner.
Queen Bess could not bear to be overlooked or slighted(!);
and as sure as she saw me bending over the magnifier with
an insect, and I thought she was ten yards off, the insect
would be incontinently snapped out of my fingers. Many
a valuable specimen disappeared in this way. I learned to
put her at these times in the sounding-board of an Æolian
harp, which was generally placed in the window. Her
majesty liked music of this kind amazingly; as the vibration
was <em>felt</em> though not heard. I presume she fancied she was
serenaded by the singing leaves of the forest. I knew she
would have remained there spell-bound until driven forth by
hunger, if I did not remove her when I was not afraid of
her company.</p>

<p>“As I have begun my ‘experiences,’” continues the same
writer, “I will go through with them and confess that I was
obliged from circumstances to attach more than accident to
her prophetic capacity&mdash;her fortune-telling. I have not a
grain of superstition to contend against in other matters,
having so much reverence for the Creator of all things that
I certainly have no fear of anything earthly or spiritually
conveyed to the senses. But I was taught by the saddest
teacher, Experience, that whenever Queen Bess’s refusal went
unheeded I was the sufferer. The first time I ever tried it
was to determine a vacillating presentiment I felt about
trying a new horse whose reputation was far from good. I
placed Queen Bess before me, held up my finger:</p>

<p>“‘Attention! Queen Bess, would you advise me to try
that horse?’</p>

<p>“She was standing on her hind legs, her antennæ erect,
wings wide spread. I repeated the question. Antennæ
fell; wings folded; and down she went, gradually, until
her head and long thorax were buried beneath her front legs.
I took her advice, and did not venture. Two days later the
horse threw his rider and killed him.</p>

<p>“Here was the turning-point. Was I to allow such folly
to master me? If French girls do take a Mantis at the junction
of three roads, and ask her on which their lover will
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_90" title="90"></a><!--091.png-->
come, and watch the insect turning and examining each
road with her weird sibyl head,<a id="Marker_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="marker">270</a>&mdash;if French girls commit
such follies, should I, a staid American woman, follow their
example&mdash;putting my faith in the caprices of an insect?
Pshaw! I was above such folly. So the next time Queen
Bess was consulted a more decided refusal was given; but
I disregarded her warning, and most sorely did I repent it.
Again she would approve, by standing more erect, if possible,
spreading and closing her wings; then all was sunshine
with me. So it went for many months. Many others
have had the same experience, if they will confess it
honestly. I learned to obey the hidden head more carefully
than any other, I am sorry to say; and I never, in
one single instance, knew her to refuse her opinion; and I
never knew it to be wrong in whatever way she announced
it.”</p>

<p>This same superstitious woman says that boys and girls
try their future expectations by making a mimic chariot,
ballasting it with small pebbles, shot, or any such like thing,
and harnessing the Mantis in with silk. Upon being
freighted she rises immediately, as if to try the weight; if
too heavy she will not fly. Lighten the chariot, and she
will soar away to a tree or a field; then her owner is to be
a lucky boy. If she will not go at all, or only a short
distance, and soon come down, misfortune is to be his
doom.<a id="Marker_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="marker">271</a></p>

<p>Other superstitions among us, with respect to the Mantis
are as follows:</p>

<p>When the Mantis (Rear-horse) kneels, it sees an angel
in the way, or hears the rustle of its wings. When it
alights on your hand, you are about to make the acquaintance
of a distinguished person; if it alights on your head,
a great honor will shortly be conferred upon you. If it injures
you in any way, which it does but seldom, you will
lose a valued friend by calumny. Never kill a Mantis, as
it bears charms against evil.</p>

<p>From the great resemblance of many species of Mantis
to the leaves of the trees upon which they feed, some travelers,
who have observed them, have declared that they saw
the leaves of trees become living creatures, and take flight.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_91" title="91"></a><!--092.png-->
Madame Merian informs us of a similar opinion among the
Indians of Surinam, who believed these insects grew like
leaves upon the trees, and when they were mature, loosened
themselves and crawled, or flew away.</p>

<p>We find also in the works of Piso an account of insects
becoming plants. Speaking of the Mantis, that author
says: “Those little animals change into a green and tender
plant, which is of two hands breadth. The feet are fixed
into the ground first; from these, when necessary humidity
is attracted, roots grow out, and strike into the ground;
thus they change by degrees, and in a short time become a
perfect plant. Sometimes only the lower part takes the
nature and form of a plant, while the upper part remains as
before, living and movable; after some time the animal is
gradually converted into a plant. In this Nature seems to
operate in a circle, by a continual retrograde motion.”<a id="Marker_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="marker">272</a></p>

<p>There may be, however, much truth in this remarkable
metamorphosis; for, that an insect may strike root into the
earth, and, from the co-operation of heat and moisture, congenial
to vegetation, produce a plant of the cryptogamic
kind, cannot be disputed. Westwood states that he has seen
a species of <i>Clavaria</i>, both of the undivided and branched
kinds, which had sprung from insects, and were four times
larger than the insects themselves. In truth, it cannot
then be denied that Piso may not have seen a plant of a
proportionate magnitude which had likewise grown out of
a Mantis. The pupæ of bees, wasps, and cicadas, have
been known to become the nidus of a plant, to throw up
stems from the front part of the head, and change in every
respect into a vegetable, and still retain the shell and exterior
appearance of the parent insect at the root. Specimens
of these vegetated animals are frequently brought
from the West Indies. Mr. Drury had a beetle in the perfect
state, from every part of which small stalks and fibers
sprouted forth; they were entirely different from the tufts
of hair that are observed in a few Coleopterous insects, such
as the <i>Buprestis fascicularius</i> of the Cape of Good Hope,
and were certainly a vegetable production.<a id="Marker_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="marker">273</a> Mr. Atwood,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_92" title="92"></a><!--093.png-->
in his account of Dominica, describes a “vegetable fly” as
follows: “It is of the appearance and size of a small Cock-chafer,
and buries itself in the ground, where it dies; and
from its body springs up a small plant, resembling a young
coffee tree, only that its leaves are smaller. The plant is
often overlooked, from the supposition people have of its
being no other than a coffee plant, but on examining it
properly, the difference is easily distinguished.… The
head, body, and feet of the insect appearing at the foot as
perfect as when alive.”<a id="Marker_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="marker">274</a></p>

<p>Dr. Colin, of Philadelphia, has mentioned, also, on the
authority of a missionary, a “vegetable fly,” similar to the
last mentioned, on the Ohio River.<a id="Marker_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="marker">275</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Sechell Islands raise the <i>Mantis
siccifolia</i>, or Dry-leaf Mantis, as an object of commerce
and natural history.</p>


<h3 id="Achetidae_Crickets">Achetidæ&mdash;Crickets.</h3>

<p>In the Island of Barbados, the natives look upon the
creaking chirp of a species of Cricket, to which Hughes
has given the name of the <i>Ash-colored</i> or <i>Sickly Cricket</i>,
when heard in the house, as an omen of death to some one
of the family.<a id="Marker_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="marker">277</a></p>

<p>In England, also, is the Cricket’s chirp sometimes looked
upon as prognosticating death. “When Blonzelind expired,”
Gay, in his Pastoral Dirge, says,</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">And shrilling Crickets in the chimney cry’d.<a id="Marker_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="marker">278</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So also in Reed’s Old Plays is the Cricket’s cry ominous
of death:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">And the strange Cricket i’ th’ oven sings and hops.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same superstition is found in the following line from
the Œdipus of Dryden and Lee:</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_93" title="93"></a><!--094.png-->


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Owels, ravens, Crickets, seem the watch of death.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Gaule mentions, among other vain observations and superstitious
ominations thereupon, “the Cricket’s chirping
behind the chimney stack, or creeping on the foot-pace.”<a id="Marker_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="marker">279</a></p>

<p>Dr. Nathaniel Horne, after saying that “by the flying
and crying of ravens over their houses, especially in the
dusk of evening, and when one is sick, they conclude death,”
adds, “the same they conclude of a Cricket crying in a
house where there was wont to be none.”<a id="Marker_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="marker">280</a></p>

<p>“Some sort of people,” says Mr. Ramsay, in his Elminthologia,
“at every turn, upon every accident, how are they
therewith terrified! If but a Cricket unusually appear, or
they hear but the clicking of a Death-watch, as they call it,
they, or some one else in the family, shall die!”<a id="Marker_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="marker">281</a></p>

<p>Gilbert White, the accurate naturalist of Selborne, speaking
of Crickets, says: “They are the house-wife’s barometer,
foretelling her when it will rain; and are prognostics sometimes,
she thinks, of ill or good luck, of the death of a near
relation, or the approach of an absent lover. By being the
constant companions of her solitary hours, they naturally
become the objects of her superstition.”<a id="Marker_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="marker">282</a></p>

<p>The voice of the Cricket, says the Spectator, has struck
more terror than the roaring of a lion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bray also notices that the Cricket’s chirp in England,
which in almost all other countries, and in that too in some
families, as will be shown hereafter, is considered a cheerful
and a welcome note, the harbinger of joy,&mdash;is deemed by
the peasantry ominous of sorrow and evil.<a id="Marker_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="marker">283</a></p>

<p>“In Dumfries-shire,” says Sir William Jardine, “it is a
common superstition that if Crickets forsake a house which
they have long inhabited, some evil will befall the family;
generally the death of some member is portended. In like
manner the presence or return of this cheerful little insect
is lucky, and portends some good to the family.”<a id="Marker_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="marker">284</a></p>

<p>Melton also says,&mdash;“17. That it is a sign of death to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_94" title="94"></a><!--095.png-->
some in that house where Crickets have been many years, if
on a sudden they forsake the chimney.”<a id="Marker_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="marker">285</a></p>

<p>The departure of Crickets from a hearth where they have
been heard, is, at the present time, in England, considered
an omen of misfortune.<a id="Marker_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="marker">286</a></p>

<p>From the above statements of Mr. White, Mrs. Bray, and
Sir William Jardine, we learn that in England the Cricket’s
chirp is not always ominous of evil, but sometimes also of
good luck, of joy, and of the approach of an absent lover.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the “Notes and Queries” mentions
the Cricket’s cry as foreboding good luck.<a id="Marker_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="marker">287</a> So also a writer
for “The Mirror,” remarking, it is singular that the House-cricket
should by some persons be considered an unlucky, by
others a lucky, inmate of the mansion. Those who hold the
latter opinion, he adds, consider the destruction of these insects
the means of bringing misfortunes on their habitations.<a id="Marker_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="marker">288</a>
Grose thus expresses this last superstition: Persons killing
these insects (including the Lady-bird, before mentioned)
will infallibly, within the course of the year, break a bone,
or meet with some other dreadful misfortune.<a id="Marker_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="marker">289</a></p>

<p>That the belief that the appearance of Crickets in a house
is a good omen, and prognosticates cheerfulness and plenty,
is pretty generally entertained in England, may be inferred
also from the manner in which it has been embodied by
Cowper, in his address to a Cricket</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Chirping on his kitchen hearth.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His words are:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Whereso’er be thine abode,</div>
<div class="line">Always harbinger of good.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And again in that admirable little tale of Charles
Dickens, entitled “The Cricket on the Hearth,” this good
and happy superstition is embodied. “It’s sure to bring us
good fortune, John! It always has been so. To have a
Cricket on the hearth is the luckiest thing in the world,”
says its heroine.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_95" title="95"></a><!--096.png-->

<p>All these superstitions are more or less entertained in
America, brought here by the English themselves, and retained
by their descendants. That the Cricket is the “harbinger
of good,” it gives me pleasure to say, is the most
common.</p>

<p>Another superstition obtaining in this country, and particularly
in Maryland and Virginia, is that Crickets are
old folks and ought not therefore to be destroyed. This
probably arose from Crickets being found about the kitchen
hearth where the old folks were accustomed to sit.</p>

<p>Milton chose for his contemplative pleasures a spot where
Crickets resorted:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Where glowing embers through the room</div>
<div class="line">Teach light to counterfeit a gloom,</div>
<div class="line">Far from all resort of mirth,</div>
<div class="line">Save the Cricket on the hearth.<a id="Marker_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="marker">290</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The learned Scaliger is said to have been particularly delighted
with the chirping of these animals, and was accustomed
to keep them in a box for his amusement in his
study.<a id="Marker_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="marker">291</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor, the writer of a very interesting series of
papers on insects for Harper’s Magazine, relates that in her
travels through Wales, she obtained several House-crickets
in the old Castle of Caernarvon. These she carried with
her, in her journeyings to and fro over the Kingdom, for
several years, and at last brought them to this country,
where they were liberated in the snuggest corner of a Southern
hearth. Again a wanderer for many years, she went back
to the old house to see how her chirping friends were coming
on, but, alas! she was told by the then residents, with the
utmost calmness, “they had had great difficulty in <em>scalding</em>
them out, and they hoped there was not one left on the
premises!”<a id="Marker_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="marker">292</a></p>

<p>In certain countries of Africa, Crickets are reported to
constitute an article of commerce. Some persons rear them,
feed them in a kind of iron oven, and sell them to the natives,
who are very fond of their music, thinking it induces sleep.<a id="Marker_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="marker">293</a>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_96" title="96"></a><!--097.png-->
De Pauw finds some traces of the Egyptian worship of the
Scarabæus in this fondness for the music of the “holy
Crickets,” as he calls them, of Madagascar! By the rearing
of which insects, he tells us, the Africans make a living, and
the rich would think themselves at enmity with heaven, if
they did not preserve whole swarms in ovens constructed
expressly for that purpose.<a id="Marker_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="marker">294</a></p>

<p>The youth of Germany, Jaeger says, are extremely fond
of Field-crickets, so much so, that there is scarcely a boy to
be seen who has not several small boxes made expressly for
keeping these insects in. So much delighted are they, too,
with their music, that they carry these boxes of Crickets
into their bed-rooms at night, and are soothed to sleep with
their chirping lullaby.<a id="Marker_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="marker">295</a></p>

<p>On the contrary, others, as has been before mentioned,
think there is something ominous and melancholy in the
Cricket’s cry, and use every endeavor to banish this insect
from their houses. “Lidelius tells us,” says Goldsmith, “of
a woman who was very much incommoded by Crickets, and
tried, but in vain, every method of banishing them from her
house. She at last accidentally succeeded; for having one
day invited several guests to her house, where there was a
wedding, in order to increase the festivity of the entertainment,
she procured drums and trumpets to entertain them.
The noise of these was so much greater than what the little
animals were accustomed to, that they instantly forsook
their situation, and were never heard in that mansion
more.”<a id="Marker_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="marker">296</a> Like many other noisy persons, Crickets like to
hear nobody louder than themselves.</p>

<p>In the Island of Sumatra, Capt. Stuart tells me, a black
Cricket is looked upon with great respect, amounting almost
to adoration. It is deemed a grievous sin to kill it.</p>

<p>Baskets full of Field-crickets, Lopes de Gomara says,
were found among the provisions of the Indians of Jamaica
when they were first discovered.<a id="Marker_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="marker">297</a></p>

<p>“The Criquet called Gryllus,” says Pliny in the words of
Holland, “doth mitigat catarrhs and all asperities offending
the throat, if the same bee rubbed therewith: also if a man
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_97" title="97"></a><!--098.png-->
doe but touch the amygdals or almonds of the throat, with
the hand wherewith he hath bruised or crushed the said
Criquet, it will appease the inflamation thereof.”<a id="Marker_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="marker">298</a> Again,
“The Cricket digged up and applied to the plase, earth and
all where it lay, is very good for the ears. Nigridius,” continues
Pliny, “attributeth many properties to this poore
creature, and esteemeth it not a little: but the Magicians
much more by a faire deale: and why so? Forsooth because
it goeth, as it were, reculing backward, it pierceth
and boreth a hole into the ground, and never ceaseth all
night long to creake very shrill.</p>

<p>“The manner of hunting and catching them is this, They
take a flie and tie it above the middest at the end of a long
haire of one’s head, and so put the said flie into the mouth
of the Cricquet’s hole; but first they blow the dust away with
their mouth, for fear lest the flie should hide herself therein;
the Cricket spies the sillie flie, seaseth upon her presently and
claspeth her round, and so they are both drawne foorth together
by the said haire.”<a id="Marker_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="marker">299</a></p>

<p>At the present time, children in France practice the same
method of capturing Crickets for amusement; substituting,
however, an ant for the “sillie flie,” and a long straw for
“the haire of one’s head.” Hence comes the common
proverb in France, <i>il est sot comme un grillon</i>. A ruse
for capturing the larva of the Cicindela, now commonly
practiced by entomologists, is founded on the same principle.</p>

<p>Pliny further says: “The Cricquets above rehearsed,
either reduced into a liniment, or else bound too, whole as
they be, cureth the accident of the lap of the eare, wounds,
contusions, bruises,” etc.<a id="Marker_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="marker">300</a></p>

<p>Dr. James, quoting Schroder and Dale, says: “The
ashes of the Cricket (<i>Gryllus domesticus</i>) exhibited, are
said to be diuretic; the expressed juice, dropped into the
eyes, is a remedy for weakness of the sight, and alleviates
disorders of the tonsils, if rubbed on them.”<a id="Marker_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="marker">301</a></p>

<p>The English name <i>Cricket</i>, the French <i>Cri-cri</i>, the
Dutch <i>Krekel</i>, and the Welsh <i>Cricell</i> and <i>Cricella</i>, are
evidently derived from the <i>creak</i>-ing sounds of these insects.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_98" title="98"></a><!--099.png-->


<h3 id="Gryllidae_Grasshoppers">Gryllidæ&mdash;Grasshoppers.</h3>

<p>Mr. Hughes, after describing an ash-colored Grasshopper
(which may be his ash-colored cricket before mentioned),<a id="Marker_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="marker">302</a>
remarks that the superstitious of the inhabitants
of Barbados are very apprehensive of some approaching
illness to the family, whenever this insect flies into their
houses in the evening or in the night.<a id="Marker_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="marker">303</a></p>

<p>Athenæus tells us the ancient Greeks used to eat the
common Grasshopper and the Monkey-grasshopper as provocatives
of the appetite. Aristophanes says:</p>


<div class="poem">

<p>Turpin tells us there is a kind of brown Grasshopper in
Siam, which the natives consider a delicate food.<a id="Marker_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="marker">305</a></p>

<p>“Fernandus Oniedus declareth furthermore,” says Peter
Martyr in his History of the West Indies, “that in a certain
region called Zenu, lying fourescore and tenne miles
from Darrina Eastwarde, they exercise a strange kinde of
marchaundize: For in the houses of the inhabitantes they
found great chests and baskets, made of twigges and leaves
of certaine trees apt for that purpose, being all ful of
Grasshoppers, Grilles, Crabbes, Crefishes, Snails also, and
Locustes, which destroie the fields of corne, all well dried
and salted. Being demanded why they reserved such a
multitude of these beastes: they answered, that they kept
them to be sowlde (sold) to the borderors, which dwell further
within the lande, and that for the exchange of these
pretious birdes, and salted fishes, they received of them
certayne straunge thinges, wherein partly they take pleasure,
and partly use them for the necessarie affaires.”<a id="Marker_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="marker">306</a></p>

<p>In the account of the voyages of J. Huighen Linschoten,
it is stated that the inhabitants of Cumana eat “horse-leeches,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_99" title="99"></a><!--100.png-->
bats, Grasshoppers, spiders, bees, and raw, sodden,
and roasted lice. They spare no living creature whatsoever,
but they eat it.”<a id="Marker_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="marker">307</a></p>

<p>“Among the choice delicacies with which the California
Digger Indians regale themselves during the summer season,”
says the Empire County Argus, “is the Grasshopper
roast. Having been an eye-witness to the preparation and
discussion of one of their feasts of Grasshoppers, we can
describe it truthfully. There are districts in California, as
well as portions of the plains between Sierra Nevada and
the Rocky Mountains, that literally swarm with Grasshoppers,
and in such astonishing numbers that a man cannot
put his foot to the ground, while walking there, without
crushing great numbers. To the Indian they are a delicacy,
and are caught and cooked in the following manner:
A piece of ground is sought where they most abound, in
the center of which an excavation is made, large and deep
enough to prevent the insect from hopping out when once
in. The entire party of Diggers, old and young, male and
female, then surround as much of the adjoining grounds as
they can, and each with a green bough in hand, whipping
and thrashing on every side, gradually approach the center,
driving the insects before them in countless multitudes, till
at last all, or nearly all, are secured in the pit. In the
mean time smaller excavations are made, answering the purpose
of ovens, in which fires are kindled and kept up till the
surrounding earth, for a short distance, becomes sufficiently
heated, together with a flat stone, large enough to cover the
oven. The Grasshoppers are now taken in coarse bags, and,
after being thoroughly soaked in salt water for a few moments,
are emptied into the oven and closed in. Ten or
fifteen minutes suffice to roast them, when they are taken
out and eaten without further preparation, and with much
apparent relish, or, as is sometimes the case, reduced to powder
and made into soup. And having from curiosity tasted,
not of the soup, but of the roast, really, if one could divest
himself of the idea of eating an insect as we do an oyster or
shrimp, without other preparation than simple roasting, they
would not be considered very bad eating, even by more refined
epicures than the Digger Indians.”<a id="Marker_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="marker">308</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_100" title="100"></a><!--101.png-->

<p>An item dated Tuesday, Aug. 21st, 1742, in the Gentleman’s
Magazine, states: “Great damage has been done to
the pastures in the country, particularly about Bristol, by
swarms of Grasshoppers; the like has happened in Pennsylvania
to a surprising degree.”<a id="Marker_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="marker">309</a></p>

<p>A common species in Sweden, the <i>Decticus verrucivorus</i>,
is employed by the native peasants to bite the warts on their
hands; the black fluid which it emits from its mouth being
supposed to possess the power of making these excrescences
vanish.<a id="Marker_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="marker">310</a> This black fluid, from whatever Grasshoppers it
may be emitted, is called by our boys “tobacco spit,” which
it much resembles; and they attribute to it also a wart-curing

Kempfer tells us, are preserved for medicinal uses, and sold

<p>Dr. James, quoting Dioscorides, says: “Grasshoppers
(<i>Locusta Anglica minor, vulgatissima</i>, Raii <i>Ins.</i> 60.) in a

incident to the female sex. The Locusta Africanus is a very
good antidote against the poison of the Scorpion.”<a id="Marker_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="marker">312</a></p>

<p>After describing the Grasshopper of Italy, Brookes says:
“It is often an amusement among the children of that country

their finger, it will whistle as long as they chuse to make it.”<a id="Marker_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="marker">313</a></p>

<p>In France, Grasshoppers are called <i>Sauterelles</i>, Hoppers;
and in Germany, <i>Heupferde</i>, Hay-horses, because they generally
feed on grasses, and their head has something of the
form of a horse’s head.</p>

<p>If Grasshoppers appear early in the summer in great
numbers, they foretell famine and drouth,&mdash;a superstition
obtaining in Maryland.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_101" title="101"></a><!--102.png-->


<h3 id="Locustidae_Locusts">Locustidæ&mdash;Locusts.</h3>

<p>Moufet says: “That Locusts should be generated of the
carkasse of a mule or asse (as Plutarch reports in the life of
Cleonides) by putrefaction, I cannot with philosophers determine;
first, because it was permitted to the Jewes to feed
on them; secondly, because no man ever yet was an eye-witness
of such a putrid and ignoble generation of Locusts.”<a id="Marker_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="marker">314</a></p>

<p>The first record of the ravages of the Locusts, which we
find in history, is the account in the Book of Exodus of the
visitation to the land of Egypt. “And the Locusts went
up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of
Egypt&mdash;very grievous were they.… For they covered
the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened;
and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of
the trees which the hail had left; and there remained not
any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field,
through all the land of Egypt.”<a id="Marker_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="marker">315</a></p>

<p>It is to the Bible, too, we go to find the best account, for
correctness and sublimity, of the appearance and ravages of
these terrific insects. It is thus given by the prophet Joel:
“A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and
of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains:
a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever
the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years
of many generations. A fire devoureth before them; and
behind them a flame burneth; the land is as the garden of
Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness;
yea, and nothing shall escape them. Like the noise of
chariots<a id="Marker_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="marker">316</a> on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the
noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a
strong people set in battle array. Before their faces the
people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.
They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall
like men of war, and they shall march every one on his ways,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_102" title="102"></a><!--103.png-->
and they shall not break their ranks; neither shall one
thrust another, they shall walk every one in his path; and
when they fall upon the sword they shall not be wounded.
They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon
the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall
enter in at the windows like a thief. The earth shall quake
before them, the heavens shall tremble; the sun<a id="Marker_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="marker">317</a> and the
moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.”
The usual way in which they are destroyed is also
noticed by the prophet. “I will remove far off from
you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren
and desolate, with his face towards the east sea, and his
hinder part towards the utmost sea, and his stink shall
come up, because he hath done great things.”<a id="Marker_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="marker">318</a></p>

<p>Paulus Orosius tells us that in the year of the world 3800,
during the consulship of M. Plautius Hypsæus, and M. Fulvius
Flaccus, such infinite myriads of Locusts were blown
from the coast of Africa into the sea and drowned, that
being cast upon the shore in immense heaps they emitted a
stench greater than could have been produced by the carcasses
of one hundred thousand men. A general pestilence
of all living creatures followed. And so great was this
plague in Numidia, where Micipsa was king, that eighty
thousand persons died; and on the sea-coast, near Carthage
and Utica, about two hundred thousand were reported to
have perished. Thirty thousand soldiers, appointed as the
garrison of Africa, and stationed in Utica, were among the
number. So violent was the destruction that the bodies of
more than fifteen hundred of these soldiers, from one gate
of the city, were carried and buried in the same day.<a id="Marker_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="marker">319</a></p>

<p>St. Augustine also mentions a plague to have arisen in
Africa from the same cause, which destroyed no less than
eight hundred thousand persons (<i>octigenta hominum millia</i>)
in the kingdom of Masanissa alone, and many more in the
territories bordering upon the sea.<a id="Marker_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="marker">320</a></p>

<p>Blown from that quarter of the globe, Locusts have occasionally
visited both Italy and Spain. The former country
was severely ravaged by myriads of these desolating intruders,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_103" title="103"></a><!--104.png-->
in the year 591. These were of a larger size than
common, as we are informed by Mouffet, who quotes an
ancient historian; and from their stench, when cast into the
sea, arose a pestilence which carried off near a million of
men and cattle.<a id="Marker_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="marker">321</a></p>

<p>In <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 677, Syria and Mesopotamia were overrun by
Locusts.<a id="Marker_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="marker">322</a></p>

<p>“About the year of our Lord 872,” we read in Wanley’s
Wonders, “came into France such an innumerable company
of Locusts, that the number of them darkened the very
light of the sun; they were of extraordinary bigness, had a
sixfold order of wings, six feet, and two teeth, the hardness
whereof surpassed that of stone. These eat up every green
thing in all the fields of France. At last, by the force of
the winds, they were carried into the sea (the Baltic) and
there drowned; after which, by the agitation of the waves,
the dead bodies of them were cast upon the shores, and from
the stench of them (together with the famine they had made
with their former devouring) there arose so great a plague,
that it is verily thought every third person in France died of
it.”<a id="Marker_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="marker">323</a> These Locusts devoured in France, on an average every
day, one hundred and forty acres; and their daily marches, or
distances of flight, were computed at twenty miles.<a id="Marker_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="marker">324</a></p>

<p>In 1271, all the cornfields of Milan were destroyed; and
in the year 1339, all those of Lombardy.<a id="Marker_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="marker">325</a> We read in
Bateman’s Doome, that in 1476, “grasshoppers and the
great rising of the river Isula did spoyle al Poland.” A
famine took place in the Venetian territory in 1478, occasioned
by these terrific scourges, in which thirty thousand
persons are reported to have perished. Mouffet mentions
many other instances of their devastations in Europe,&mdash;in
France, Spain, Italy, and Germany.<a id="Marker_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="marker">326</a></p>

<p>A passage of Locusts in France, in 1613, entirely cut up,
even to the very roots, more than fifteen thousand acres of
corn in the neighborhood of Arles, and had even penetrated
into the barns and granaries, when, as it were by Providence,
many hundreds of birds, especially starlings, came to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_104" title="104"></a><!--105.png-->
diminish their numbers. Notwithstanding this, nothing
could be more astonishing than their multiplication, for the
fecundity of the Locust is very remarkable. Upon an order
issued by government, for the collection of their eggs, more
than three thousand measures were collected, from each of
which, it was calculated, would have issued nearly two millions
of young ones.<a id="Marker_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="marker">327</a> In 1650, they entered Russia, in immense
divisions, in three different places; thence passed over
into Poland and Lithuania, where the air was darkened by
their numbers. In many parts they lay dead to the depth
of four feet. Sometimes they covered the surface of the
earth like a dark cloud, loaded the trees, and the destruction
which they produced exceeded all calculation.<a id="Marker_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="marker">328</a> In
1645, immense swarms visited the islands of Formosa and
Tayowan, and caused such a famine that eight thousand
persons died of hunger.<a id="Marker_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="marker">329</a></p>

<p>“In 1649,” says Sir Hans Sloane, “the Locusts destroyed
all the products of the island of Teneriffe. They came from
the coast of Barbary, the wind being a Levant thence.
They flew as far as they could, then one alighted in the sea,
and another on it, so that one after another they made a
heap as big as the greatest ship above water, and were esteemed
almost as many under. Those above water, next
day, after the sun’s refreshing them, took flight again, and
came in clouds to the island, whence the inhabitants had
perceived them in the air, and had gathered all the soldiers
of the island and of Laguna together, being 7 or 8000 men,
who laying aside their arms, some took bags, some spades,
and having notice by their scouts from the hills when they
alighted, they went straight thither, made trenches, and
brought their bags full, and covered them with mould.…
After two months fruitless management of them in this
manner, the ecclesiastics took them in hand by penances, etc.
But all would not do: the Locusts staid their four months;
cattle eat them and died, and so did several men, and others
stuck out in botches. The other Canary islands were so
troubled, also, that they were forced to bury their provisions.
They were troubled forty years before with the like
calamity.”<a id="Marker_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="marker">330</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_105" title="105"></a><!--106.png-->

<p>Barbot, after mentioning a famine that happened in North
Guinea in 1681, which destroyed many thousands of the inhabitants
of the Continent, and forced many to sell themselves
for slaves, to only get sustenance, says these fearful
famines are also some years occasioned by the dreadful
swarms of Locusts, which come from the eastward and spread
over the whole country in such prodigious multitudes, that
they darken the very air, passing over head like mighty
clouds. They leave nothing that is green wheresoever they
come, either on the ground or trees, and fly so swiftly from
place to place, that whole provinces are devastated in a very
short time. Barbot adds, terrific storms of hail, wind, and
such like judgments from Heaven, are nothing to compare
to this, which when it happens, there is no question to be
made but that multitudes of the natives must starve,
having no neighboring countries to supply them with corn,
because those round about them are no better husbands
than themselves, and are no less liable to the same calamities.<a id="Marker_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="marker">331</a></p>

<p>Of a swarm, which in the year 1693 covered four square
miles of ground, a German author has made the following
estimate. Observing that, when he trod on the ground, at
least three were crushed, and that in a square German measure,
less than an English foot, ten were destroyed; and after
determining the number of these square measures in the
four miles, he concluded that ninety-two billions, one hundred
and sixty millions of Locusts were congregated on the
surface. This is altogether a very moderate calculation, for
not only is their number more compact in breadth, but they
are often piled knee-high on the earth.<a id="Marker_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="marker">332</a></p>

<p>In 1724, Dr. Shaw was a witness of the devastations of
these insects in Barbary. He has given us a description of
their habits.<a id="Marker_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="marker">333</a> For four successive years, from 1744 to 1747,
Locusts ravaged the southern provinces of Spain and Portugal.<a id="Marker_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="marker">334</a>
In a letter from Transylvania, dated August 22d,
1747, a graphic description is given of two vast columns
that overswept that country. “They form,” says the writer,
“a close compact column about fifteen yards deep, in breadth
about four musket-shot, and in length about four leagues;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_106" title="106"></a><!--107.png-->
they move with such force, or rather precipitation, that the
air trembles to such a degree as to shake the leaves upon
the trees, and they darkened the sky in such a manner, that
when they passed over us I could not see my people at
twenty feet distance.”<a id="Marker_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="marker">335</a> This flight was four hours in passing
over the Red Tower. The guards here attempted to
stop them, by firing cannon at them; and where, indeed,
the balls and shot swept through the swarm, they gave way
and divided; but, having filled up their ranks in a moment,
they proceeded on their journey.<a id="Marker_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="marker">336</a> In an item dated Hermanstadt,
July 24, 1748, it is stated that on the day before,
a hussar, coming from the plague committee, saw such a
host of these insects near Szanda, that they covered the
country for a mile round, and were so thick, that he was
obliged to dismount from his horse, and halt for three hours,
until the inhabitants of the district, coming with all sorts of
instruments, beat about and forced with loud cries these
pests to quit the spot.<a id="Marker_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="marker">337</a> In another item, dated Warsaw,
August 15, 1748, it is stated that a certain prince sent out
soldiers against the Locusts, who fired upon them not only
with small arms, but with cannons. They succeeded in dividing
the Locusts, but unluckily with the noise frightened
away the storks and cranes which daily consume many of
these insects.<a id="Marker_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="marker">338</a> Some stragglers from these swarms which
so desolated Wallachia, Moldavia, Transylvania, Hungary,
and Poland, in the years 1747 and ’48, made their way into
England, where they caused some alarm.<a id="Marker_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="marker">339</a> During this grand
invasion of Europe, they even crossed the Baltic, and visited
Sweden in 1749. Charles the Twelfth, in Bessarabia, imagined
himself, it is said, assailed by a hurricane, mingled
with tremendous hail, when a cloud of these insects suddenly
falling, and covering both men and horses, arrested his entire
army in its march.<a id="Marker_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="marker">340</a></p>

<p>During the devastations committed by the Locusts in
Spain in 1754, ’55, ’56, and ’57, a body of them entered the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_107" title="107"></a><!--108.png-->
church of Almaden, and devoured the silk garments that
adorned the images of the saints, not sparing even the
varnish on the altars.<a id="Marker_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="marker">341</a></p>

<p>In 1750 and ’53 Poland was again devastated by Locusts.<a id="Marker_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="marker">342</a>
In June, 1772, there were several swarms of “large black
flies of the Locust kind,” that did incredible damage to the
fruits of the earth, seen in England. Salt water, it is said,
was found effectual in destroying them.<a id="Marker_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="marker">343</a></p>

<p>From 1778 to 1780 the empire of Morocco was terribly
devastated by Locusts: every green thing was eaten up, not
even the bitter bark of the orange and pomegranate escaping&mdash;a
most dreadful famine ensued. The poor wandered
over the country, in search of a wretched subsistence from the
roots of plants. They picked, from the dung of camels, the
undigested grains of barley, and devoured them with eagerness.
Vast numbers perished, and the streets and roads
were strewed with the unburied carcasses. On this sad occasion,
fathers sold their children, and husbands their wives.
When they visit a country, says Mr. Jackson, from whom
we have gathered the above facts, speaking of the same
empire, it behooves every one to lay in provision for a
famine, for they stay from three to seven years. When they
have devoured all other vegetables, they attack the trees,
consuming first the leaves and then the bark.<a id="Marker_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="marker">344</a></p>

<p>To prevent the fatal consequences which would have resulted
from a passage of Locusts in 1780 near Bontzhida, in
Transylvania, fifteen hundred persons were ordered each to
gather a sack full of the insects, part of which were crushed,
part burned, and part interred. Notwithstanding this, very
little diminution was remarked in their numbers, so astonishing
was their multiplication, until very cold and sharp
weather had come on. In the following spring there were
millions of eggs disinterred and destroyed by the people,
who were levied “en masse” for the operation; but notwithstanding
all this, many places of tolerable extent were
still to be found, in which the soil was covered with young
Locusts, so that not a single spot was left naked. These
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_108" title="108"></a><!--109.png-->
were finally, however, swept into ditches, the opposite sides
of which were provided with cloths tightly stretched, and
crushed.<a id="Marker_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="marker">345</a></p>

<p>When the provincial governors of Spain are informed in
the spring that Locusts have been seen, they collect the
soldiers and peasants, divide them into companies and surround
the district. Every man is furnished with a long
broom, with which he strikes the ground, and thus drives
the young Locusts toward a common center, where a vast
excavation, with a quantity of brushwood, is prepared for
their reception, and where the flame destroys them. Three
thousand men were thus employed, in 1780, for three weeks,
at Zamora; and it was reckoned that the quantity collected
exceeded 10,000 bushels.<a id="Marker_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="marker">346</a> In 1783, 400 bushels more were
collected and destroyed in the same way.<a id="Marker_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="marker">347</a></p>

<p>Mr. Barrow informs us that in South Africa, in 1784 and
1797, two thousand square miles were literally covered by
Locusts, which, being carried into the sea by a northwest
wind, formed, for fifty miles along shore, a bank three or
four feet high; and when the wind was in the opposite point,
the horrible odor which they exhaled was perceptible a
hundred and fifty miles off.<a id="Marker_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="marker">348</a></p>

<p>The immense column of Locusts which ravaged all the
Mahratta territory, and was thought to have come from
Arabia, extended, Mr. Kirby’s friend told him, five hundred
miles, and was so dense as thoroughly to hide the sun, and
prevent any object from casting a shadow. This horde was
not composed of the migratory Locust, but of a red species,
which imparted a sanguine color to the trees on which they
settled.<a id="Marker_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="marker">349</a></p>

<p>Mr. Forbes describes a flight of Locusts which he saw
soon after his arrival at Baroche in 1779. It was more than
a mile in length, and half as much in breadth, and appeared,
as the sun was in the meridian, like a black cloud at a distance.
As it approached, its density obscured the solar
rays, causing a gloom like that of an eclipse, over the gardens,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_109" title="109"></a><!--110.png-->
and causing a noise like the rushing of a torrent.
They were almost an hour in passing a given point.<a id="Marker_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="marker">350</a></p>

<p>In another place, this traveler states that, in one considerable
tract near the confines of the Brodera district, he
witnessed a mournful scene, occasioned by a scourge of Locusts.
They had, some time before he came, alighted in
that part of the country, and left behind them, he says,
“an awful contrast to the general beauty of that earthly
paradise.” The sad description of Hosea, he adds, was
literally realized: “That which the palmer-worm hath left,
hath the caterpillar eaten. They have laid waste the vine,
and barked the fig-tree; they have made it clean bare, and
the branches thereof are made white: the pomegranate-tree,
the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the
trees of the field are withered. Howl, O ye husbandmen!
for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the
field is perished. How do the beasts groan! The herds
of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea,
the flocks of sheep are made desolate!”<a id="Marker_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="marker">351</a></p>

<p>On the 16th of May, 1800, Buchanan met with in Mysore
a flight of Locusts which extended in length about three
miles. He compares the noise they made to the sound of
a cataract.<a id="Marker_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="marker">352</a> This swarm was very destructive to the young
crops of jola.<a id="Marker_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="marker">353</a></p>

<p>In 1811, at Smyrna, at right angles to a flight of Locusts,
a man rode forty miles before he got rid of the moving
column. This immense flight continued for three days and
nights, apparently without intermission. It was computed
that the lowest number of Locusts in this swarm must have
exceeded 168,608,563,200,200! Captain Beaufort determined
that the Locusts of this flight, which he himself saw,
if framed into a heap, would have exceeded in magnitude
more than a thousand and thirty times the largest pyramid
of Egypt; or if put on the ground close together, in a band
of a mile and an eighth in width, would have encircled the
globe! This immense swarm caused such a famine in the
district of Marwar, that the natives fled for subsistence in a
living torrent into Guzerat and Bombay; and out of every
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_110" title="110"></a><!--111.png-->
hundred of these Marwarees, Captain Carnac estimates,
ninety-nine died that year! Near the town of Baroda, these
poor people perished at the rate of five hundred a day; and
at Ahmedabad, a large city of two hundred thousand inhabitants,
one hundred thousand died from this awful visitation!<a id="Marker_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="marker">354</a></p>

<p>In 1816, Captain Riley met with a flight of Locusts in
the north of Africa, which extended in length about eight
miles, and in breadth three. He tells us, also, he was informed
that several years before he came to Mogadore,
nearly all the Locusts in the empire, which at that time
were very numerous, and had laid waste the country, were
carried off in one night, and drowned in the Atlantic Ocean:
that their dead carcasses a few days afterward were driven
by winds and currents on shore, all along the western coast,
extending from near Cape Spartel to beyond Mogadore,
forming in many places immense piles on the beach: that
the stench arising from their remains was intolerable, and
was supposed to have produced the plague which broke out
about that time in various parts of the Moorish dominions.<a id="Marker_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="marker">355</a>
Before this plague in 1799, Mr. Jackson tells us, from
Mogadore to Tangier the face of the earth was covered by
them, and relates the following singular incident which occurred
at El Araiche: The whole region from the confines
of the Sahara was ravaged by the Locusts; but on the other
side of the river El Kos not one of them was to be seen,
though there was nothing to prevent their flying over it.
Till then they had proceeded northward; but upon arriving
at its banks they turned to the east, so that all the country
north of El Araiche was full of pulse, fruits and grain, exhibiting
a most striking contrast to the desolation of the
adjoining district. At length they were all carried by a
violent hurricane into the Western Ocean; the shore, as in
former instances, was covered by their carcasses, and a pestilence
(confirming the statement, and verifying the supposition
of Captain Riley) was caused by the horrid stench
which they emitted: but when this evil ceased, their devastations
were followed by a most abundant crop.<a id="Marker_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="marker">356</a></p>

<p>In 1825 the Russian empire was overrun to a very alarming
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_111" title="111"></a><!--112.png-->
extent by young Locusts. About Kiew, as far as the eye
could reach, they lay piled up one upon another to the height
of two feet. Through the government of Ekatharinoslaw
and Cherson to the Black Sea, a distance of about 400
miles, they covered the ground so thickly that a horse could
not walk fast through them. The sight of such an immense
number, says an eye-witness, Mr. Jaeger, of the most destructive
and rapacious insects, justly occasioned a melancholy
foreboding of famine and pestilence, in case they should invade
the cultivated and populous countries of Russia and
Poland. It was at this juncture, however, that the Emperor
Alexander sent his army of thirty thousand soldiers to destroy
them. These forming a line of several hundred miles,
and advancing toward the south, attacked them with
shovels, and collected them, as far as possible, in sacks and
burned them. This is the largest army of soldiers sent
against Locusts we have any record of.<a id="Marker_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="marker">357</a></p>

<p>In 1824, Locusts made their appearance at the Glen-Lynden
Colony in South Africa, being the first time they
had been seen there since 1808. In 1825, they continued
to advance from the north; in 1826, the corn crops at
Glen-Lynden were totally destroyed by them; and in 1827,
1828, and 1829, they extended their ravages through the
whole of the northern and southern districts of the colony.
In 1830, they again disappeared.<a id="Marker_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="marker">358</a></p>

<p>The following graphic description of the swarm that
visited Glen-Lynden in 1825 is from the pen of Mr. Pringle.
He says: “In returning to Glen-Lynden, we passed through
a flying swarm, which had exactly the appearance, as it approached,
of a vast snow-cloud hanging on the slope of a
mountain from which the snow was falling in very large
flakes. When we got into the midst of them, the air all
around and above was darkened as by a thick cloud; and
the rushing sound of the wings of the millions of these insects
was as loud as the dash of a mill-wheel.… The
column that we thus passed through was, as nearly as I
could calculate, about half a mile in breadth, and from two
to three miles in length.”<a id="Marker_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="marker">359</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_112" title="112"></a><!--113.png-->

<p>In 1835, a plague of Locusts made their appearance in
China, in the neighborhood of Quangse, and in the western
departments of Quangtung. The military and people were
ordered out to exterminate them, as they had done two years
before. A more rational mode, however, was adopted by
the authorities, of offering a bounty of twelve or fifteen cash
per catty of the insects. They were gathered so fast for
this price, that it was immediately lowered to five or six
cash per catty. A strike followed, and the Locusts were
left in quiet to do as much damage as they could.<a id="Marker_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="marker">360</a></p>

<p>Nieuhoff tells us, Locusts in the East Indies are so destructive
that the inhabitants are oftentimes obliged to change
their habitations, for want of sustenance. He adds that
this has frequently happened in China and the Island of
Tojowac.<a id="Marker_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="marker">361</a></p>

<p>In 1828&ndash;9, in the provinces lying between the Black and
Caspian Seas, Locusts appeared in such vast numbers as
were never seen in that country before.<a id="Marker_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="marker">362</a></p>

<p>In 1839, Kaffraria was again visited by Locusts, which,
together with the war at that time, caused so great a famine
that many persons perished for want of subsistence.<a id="Marker_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="marker">363</a> Again
in 1849&ndash;50, this country was visited by this dreadful scourge.
The whole country, says the Rev. Francis Fleming, was
covered with them; and when they arose, the cloud was so
dense that this gentleman was obliged to dismount, and
wait till they passed over.<a id="Marker_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="marker">364</a></p>

<p>Mr. Jules Remy says, that at his arrival at Salt Lake, he
observed upon the shore, on the top of the salt, a deposit of
a foot deep which was entirely composed of dead Locusts&mdash;<i>Œdipoda
corallipes</i>. These insects, driven by a high wind
in prodigiously thick clouds, had been drowned in the lake,
after having, during the course of the summer (of 1855),
destroyed the rising crops, and even the prairie grass. A
famine ensued; but the Mormons, continues Mr. Remy,
only saw in this scourge a fresh proof of the truth of their
religion, because it had happened, as among the Israelites,
in the seventh year after their settlement in the country.<a id="Marker_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="marker">365</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_113" title="113"></a><!--114.png-->

<p>According to Lieutenant Warren, whose graphic description
is here borrowed, these devastating insects of our great
western plains are “nearly the same as the Locusts of
Egypt; and no one,” continues this officer, “who has not
traveled on the prairie, and seen for himself, can appreciate
the magnitude of the swarms. Often they fill the air
for many miles in extent, so that an inexperienced eye can
scarcely distinguish their appearance from that of a shower
of rain or the smoke of a prairie fire. The height of their
flight may be somewhat appreciated, as Mr. Evans saw them
above his head, as far as their size would render them visible,
while standing on the top of a peak of the Rocky Mountains
8500 feet above the plain, and an elevation of 14,500
above that of the sea, in the region where the snow lies all
the year. To a person standing in one of the swarms as
they pass over and around him, the air becomes sensibly
darkened, and the sound produced by their wings resembles
that of the passage of a train of cars on a railroad, when
standing two or three hundred yards from the track. The
Mormon settlements have suffered more from the ravages of
these insects than probably all other causes combined. They
destroyed nearly all the vegetables cultivated last year at Fort
Randall, and extended their ravages east as far as Iowa.”<a id="Marker_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="marker">366</a></p>

<p>The Mormons, in their simple and picturesque descriptions,
say that these insects (“Crickets”&mdash;<i>Œdipoda corallipes</i>,

Spider and the Buffalo.”<a id="Marker_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="marker">367</a></p>

<p>In Egypt, in 1843, the popular idea was that the hordes
of Locusts, which were then ravaging the land, were sent by
the comet observed about that time for twelve days in the
southwest.<a id="Marker_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="marker">368</a></p>

<p>Pliny, in the words of his translator, Holland, says:
“Many a time have the Locusts been knowne to take their
flight out of Affricke, and with whole armies to infest Italie:
many a time have the people of Rome, fearing a great famine
and scarcity toward, beene forced to have recourse unto
Sybil’s bookes for remedie, and to avert the ire of the gods.

In the Cyrenaick region within Barbarie, ordained it is by
law, every three years to wage warre against them, and so
to conquer them.… Yea, and a grievous punishment
lieth upon him that is negligent in this behalf, as if hee were
a traitour to his prince and countrey. Moreover, within
the Island Lemnos there is a certaine proportion and measure
set down, how many and what quantity every man shall kill;
and they are to exhibit unto the magistrate a just and true
account thereof, and namely, to shew what measure full of
dead Locusts. And for this purpose they make much of
Iaies, Dawes, and Choughs, whom they do honour highly,
because they doe flie opposite against the Locusts, and so
destroy them. Moreover in Syria, they are forced to levie
a warlike power of men against them, and to make ridance
by that means.”<a id="Marker_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="marker">369</a></p>

<p>Democritus says, if a cloud of Locusts is coming forward,
let all persons remain quiet within doors, and they will pass
over the place; but if they suddenly arrive before they are
observed, they will hurt nothing, if you boil bitter lupines,
or wild cucumbers, in brine, and sprinkle it, for they will immediately
die. They will likewise pass over the subjacent
spot, continues Democritus, if you catch some bats and tie
them on the high trees of the place; and if you take and
burn some of the Locusts, they are rendered torpid from the
smell, and some indeed die, and some drooping their wings,
await their pursuers, and they are destroyed by the sun.
You will drive away Locusts, continues this same writer, if
you prepare some liquor for them, and dig trenches, and besprinkle
them with the liquor; for if you come there afterward,
you will find them oppressed with sleep; but how you
are to destroy them is to be your concern. A Locust will
touch nothing, he concludes, if you pound absinthium, or a
leek, or centaury with water, and sprinkle it.<a id="Marker_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="marker">370</a></p>

<p>Didymus says, to preserve vines from that species of
Locusts called by the ancients <i>Bruchus</i>, set three grains of
mustard around the stem of the vine at the root; for these
being thus set, have the power of destroying the Bruchus.<a id="Marker_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="marker">371</a></p>

<p>Nieuhoff tells us that when a swarm of Locusts is seen in
China, the inhabitants, to prevent their alighting, “march to
and again the fields with their colors flying, shouting and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_115" title="115"></a><!--116.png-->
hallooing all the while; never leaving them till they are
driven into the sea, or some river, where they fall down and
are drowned.”<a id="Marker_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="marker">372</a></p>

<p>Volney says, that when the Locusts first make their appearance
on the frontiers of Syria, the inhabitants strive to
drive them off by raising large clouds of smoke; and if, as
it too frequently happens, their herbs and wet straw fail them,
they dig trenches, in which they bury them in great numbers.
The most efficacious destroyers of these insects are, however,
he adds, the south and southeasterly winds, and the
bird called the Samarmar.<a id="Marker_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="marker">373</a></p>

<p>Capt. Riley tells us, it is said at Mogadore, and believed
by the Moors, Christians, and Jews, that the Bereberies inhabiting
the Atlas Mountains have the power to destroy
every flight of Locusts that comes from the south, and from
the east, and thus ward off this scourge from all the countries
north and west of this stupendous ridge, merely by
building large fires on the parts of the mountains over
which the Locusts are known always to pass, and in the
season when they are likely to appear, which is at a definite
period, within a certain number of days in almost every year.
The Atlas being high, and the peaks covered with snow,
these insects become chilled in passing over them, when,
seeing the fires, they are attracted by the glare, and plunge
into the flame. What degree of credit ought to be attached
to this opinion, Capt. Riley says he does not know, but is
certain that the Moorish Sultan used to pay a considerable
sum of money yearly to certain inhabitants of the sides of
the Atlas, in order to keep the Locusts out of his dominions.
He also adds, the Moors and Jews affirmed to him, that
during the time in which the Sultan paid the said yearly
stipend punctually, not a Locust was to be seen in his dominions;
but that when the Emperor refused to pay the
stipulated sum, because no Locusts troubled his country,
and thinking he had been imposed upon, that the very same
year the Locusts again made their appearance, and have
continued to lay waste the country ever since.<a id="Marker_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="marker">374</a></p>

<p>An impostor, who is believed to have been a French adventurer,
at one time, it is said, endeavored to persuade the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_116" title="116"></a><!--117.png-->
people of Morocco that he could destroy all the Locusts by
a chemical process.<a id="Marker_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="marker">375</a></p>

<p>The superstitious Tartars of the Crimea, in order to rid
their country of its most destructive enemy, the Locusts, at
one time sent over to Asia Minor, whence these insects
had come, to procure Dervises to drive them away by their
incantations, etc. These divines prayed around the mosques,
and, as a charm, ordered water to be hung out on the minarets,
which, with the prayers, were meant to entice a species
of blackbird to come in multitudes and devour the Locusts!
The water thus hung out is said to be still preserved in the
mosques. On this occasion, the Dervises collected eighty
thousand rubles, the poorest shepherd giving half a ruble.<a id="Marker_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="marker">376</a></p>

<p>We read in “Purchas’s Pilgrims,” of Locusts being exorcised
and excommunicated, so that they immediately flew
away!<a id="Marker_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="marker">377</a> From this interesting collection the following is
clipped: “In the yeere 1603, at Fremona, great misery happened
by Grasse-hoppers, from which Paez freed the Catholikes,
by Letanies and sprinkling the Fields with Holy-water;
when as the Fields of Heretikes, seuered only by a Ditch,
were spoyled by them. Yea, a Heretike vsing this sacred
sprinkling, preserued his corne, which, to a Catholike neglecting
in one Field, was lost, and preserued in another by
that couiured aspersion (so neere of kinne are these Locusts
to the Deuill, which is said to hate Holy-water).”<a id="Marker_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="marker">378</a></p>

<p>In the south of Europe rewards are offered for the collection
both of the Locusts and their eggs; and at Marseilles,
it is on record that, in the year 1613, 20,000 francs
were paid for this purpose. In 1825, the same city paid a
sum of 6200 francs for destroying these pests to agriculture.<a id="Marker_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="marker">379</a>
We read in the eighty-first volume of the Gentleman’s
Magazine, that most of the Agricultural Societies of
Italy have offered premiums for the best method of destroying
Locusts: that in many districts several thousand persons
are employed in searching for the eggs; that in four days
the inhabitants of the district of Ofanto collected at one
time 80,000 sacks full, which were thrown into the river.<a id="Marker_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="marker">380</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_117" title="117"></a><!--118.png-->

<p>The noise Locusts make when engaged in the work of
destruction has been compared to the sound of a flame of
fire driven by the wind, and the effect of their bite to that of
fire.<a id="Marker_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="marker">381</a> Volney says: “The noise they make, in browsing on
the trees and herbage, may be heard at a great distance, and
resembles that of an army foraging in secret.” His following
sentence may also be introduced here: “The Tartars
themselves are a less destructive enemy than these little animals.”<a id="Marker_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="marker">382</a>
Robbins compares their noise to that of small pigs
when eating corn.<a id="Marker_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="marker">383</a> The noise produced by their flight and
approach, the poet Southey has strikingly described:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Onward they came a dark continuous cloud</div>
<div class="line">Of congregated myriads numberless,</div>
<div class="line">The rushing of whose wings was as the sound</div>
<div class="line">Of a broad river headlong in its course</div>
<div class="line">Plunged from a mountain summit, or the roar</div>
<div class="line">Of a wild ocean in the autumn storm,</div>
<div class="line">Shattering its billows on a shore of rocks!<a id="Marker_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="marker">384</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another comparison may be introduced here, to give some
idea of the infinite numbers of these insects. Dr. Clarke
compares a cloud of them to a flight of snow when the
flakes are carried obliquely by the wind. They covered his
carriage and horses, and the Tartars assert that people are
sometimes suffocated by them. The whole face of nature
might have been described as covered with a living veil.
They consisted of two species&mdash;<i>Locusta tartarica</i> and <i>L.
migratoria;</i> the first is almost twice the size of the second,
and, because it precedes it, is called by the Tartars the
herald or messenger.<a id="Marker_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="marker">385</a></p>

<p>In the Account of the admirable Voyage of Domingo
Gonsales, the little Spaniard, to the World of the Moon, by
Help of several Gansa’s, or large Geese, we find the following:
“One accident more befel me worth mention, that during
my stay, I say, I saw a kind of a reddish cloud coming toward
me, and continually approaching nearer, which, at last,
I perceived, was nothing but a huge swarm of Locusts. He
that reads the discources of learned men concerning them
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_118" title="118"></a><!--119.png-->
(as John Leo, of Africa, and others, who relate that they
are seen for several days in the air before they fall on the
earth), and adds thereto this experience of mine, will easily
conclude that they can come from no other place than the
globe of the moon.”<a id="Marker_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="marker">386</a></p>

<p>To accompany this piece of satire, the following suits
well:</p>

<p>A Chinese author, quoted by Rev. Thomas Smith, observes,
that Locusts never appear in China but when great
floods are followed by a very dry season; and that it is his
opinion that they are hatched by the sun from the spawn of
fish left by the waters on the ground!<a id="Marker_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="marker">387</a></p>

<p>So far the history of the Locust has been but a series of
the greatest calamities which human nature has suffered&mdash;famine,
pestilence, and death. No wonder that, in all ages
and times, these insects have so deeply impressed the imagination,
that almost all people have looked on them with
superstitious horror. We have shown how that their devastations
have entered into the history of nations. Their
effigies, too, like those of other conquerors of the earth,
have been perpetuated in coins.</p>

<p>We are the army of the great God, and we lay ninety-and-nine
eggs; were the hundredth put forth, the world would be
ours&mdash;such is the speech the Arabs put into the mouth of
the Locust. And such is the feeling the Arabs entertain of
this insect, that they give it a remarkable pedigree, and the
following description of its person: It has the head of the
horse, the horns of the stag, the eye of the elephant, the
neck of the ox, the breast of the lion, the body of the scorpion,
the hip of the camel, the legs of the stork, the wings
of the eagle, and the tail of the dragon.<a id="Marker_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="marker">388</a></p>

<p>The Mohammedans say, that after God had created man
from clay, of that which was left he made the Locust: and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_119" title="119"></a><!--120.png-->
in utter despair, they look upon this devastating scourge as
a just chastisement from heaven for their or their nation’s
sins, or as directed by that fatality in which they all believe.<a id="Marker_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="marker">389</a></p>

<p>The wings of some Locusts being spotted, were thought
by many to be leaves from the book of fate, in which letters
announcing the destiny of nations were to be read. Paul
Jetzote, professor of Greek literature at the Gymnasium of
Stettin, wrote a work on the meaning of three of these letters,
which were, according to him, to be seen on the wings
of those Locusts which visited Silesia in 1712. These letters
were B.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;S., and formed the initials of the Latin
words “Bella Erunt Sæva,” or “Babel Est Solitudo;” also
the German words, “Bedeutet Erschreckliche Schlacten,”
portending frightful battles, “Bedeutet und Erfreuliche
Siege,” portending happy victories. There are Greek and
Hebrew sentences likewise, in which, no doubt, the professor
showed as much learning, judgment, and spirit of
prophecy as in those already quoted.<a id="Marker_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="marker">390</a></p>

<p>A quite common belief in our own country is, that every
Locust’s wing is marked with either the letter W, portending
War, or the letter P, portending Peace.</p>

<p>Not content with the dreadful presence of this plague, the
inhabitants of most countries took that opportunity of adding
to their present misery by prognosticating future evils.
The direction of their flight pointed out the kingdom doomed
to bow under the divine wrath. The color of the insect
designated the national uniform of such armies as were to
go forth and conquer.<a id="Marker_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="marker">391</a></p>

<p>Aldrovandus states, on the authority of Cruntz, that
Tamerlane’s army being infested by Locusts, that chief
looked on it as a warning from God, and desisted from his
designs on Jerusalem.<a id="Marker_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="marker">392</a></p>

<p>Mouffet says: “If any credit may be given to Apomasaris,
a man most learned in the learning of the Indians, Persians,
and Egyptians, to dream of the coming of Locusts is a sign
of an army coming against us, and so much as they shall
seem to hurt or not hurt us, so shall the enemy.”<a id="Marker_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="marker">393</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_120" title="120"></a><!--121.png-->

<p>We now turn to the history of the Locust as an article
of food&mdash;a striking benefit directly derived from insects.
For as they are the greatest destroyers of food, so as some
recompense they furnish a considerable supply of it to numerous
nations&mdash;as they cause, they are frequently the means
of preventing famines. They are recorded to have done
this from the remotest antiquity.</p>

<p>In the curious account given by Alexis of a poor Athenian
family’s provisions, mention of this insect is found:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">For our best and daintiest cheer,</div>
<div class="line">Through the bright half of the year,</div>
<div class="line">Is but acorns, onions, peas,</div>
<div class="line">Ochros, lupines, radishes,</div>
<div class="line">Vetches, wild pears nine and ten,</div>
<div class="line">With a Locust now and then.<a id="Marker_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="marker">394</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Diodorus Siculus, who lived about threescore years before
our Saviour’s birth, first, if I mistake not, described
the Acridophagi, or Locust-eaters, of Ethiopia. He says
they are smaller than other men, of lean and meager
bodies, and exceeding black: that in the spring the south
winds rise high, and drive an infinite number of Locusts out
of the desert, of an extraordinary bigness, furnished with
most dirty and nasty colored wings; and these are plentiful
food and provision for them all their days. This historian
has also given us an account of their peculiar mode of
catching these insects: In their country there is a large and
deep vale, extending far in length for many furlongs together:
all over this they lay heaps of wood and other
combustible material, and when the swarms of Locusts are
driven thither by the force of the winds, then some of the
inhabitants go to one part of the valley, and some to another,
and set the grass and other combustible matter on fire, which
was before thrown among the piles; whereupon arises a
great and suffocating smoke, which so stifles the Locusts as
they fly over the vale, that they soon fall down dead to the
ground. This destruction of them, he continues, is continued
for many days together, so that they lie in great
heaps; and the country being full of salt, they gather these
heaps together, and season them sufficiently with this salt,
which gives them an excellent relish, and preserves them a
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_121" title="121"></a><!--122.png-->
long time sweet, so that they have food from these insects all
the year round.</p>

<p>Diodorus concludes his history of this people, with an
account of the strange and wonderful death that comes to
them at an early age, the result of eating this kind of food:
They are exceeding short-lived, never living to be over
forty; and when they grow old, winged lice breed in their
flesh, not only of divers sorts, but of horrid and ugly shapes;
that this plague begins first at the abdomen and breast, and
in a short time eats and consumes the whole body. (<i>Phthiriasis.</i>)<a id="Marker_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="marker">395</a></p>

<p>Strabo, most probably quoting from the above passage
from Diodorus, speaks of a nation bordering on that of the
Struthophagi, or Bird-eaters, whose food consisted entirely
of Locusts, and who were carried off by the same most horrible
disease.<a id="Marker_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="marker">396</a></p>

<p>Pliny remarks: “The people of the East countries make
their food of grasshoppers, even the very Parthians, who
otherwise abound in wealth.”<a id="Marker_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="marker">397</a></p>

<p>The Arabs, who are compelled at the present day to inhabit
the desert of Sahara, welcome the approach of Locusts
as the means, oftentimes, of saving them from famishing
with hunger. Robbins tells us their manner of preparing
these insects for food is, by digging a deep hole in the
ground, building a fire at the bottom, and filling it with
wood. Then, after the earth is heated as hot as possible,
and the coals and embers taken out, they prepare to fill the
cavity with the live Locusts, confined in a bag holding about
five bushels. Several hold the bag perpendicularly over the
hole with the mouth near the surface of the ground, while
others stand round with sticks. The bag is then opened,
and the Locusts shaken with great force into the hot pit,
while the surrounding persons immediately throw sand upon
them to prevent their flying off. The mouth of the hole is
now completely covered with sand, and another fire built
upon the top of it. When the Locusts are thoroughly roasted
and become cool, they are picked out with the hand,
thrown upon tent-cloths, or blankets, and placed in the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_122" title="122"></a><!--123.png-->
sun to dry. During this process, which requires two or
three days, they must be watched with the utmost care, to
prevent the live Locusts from devouring them, if a flight
should happen to be passing at the time. When perfectly
dry, they are pounded slightly, pressed into bags, or skins,
and are ready for transportation. To prepare them now for
present eating, they are pulverized in mortars, and mixed
with water sufficient to make a kind of dry pudding. They
are, however, sometimes eaten singly without pulverizing,
after breaking off the head, wings, and legs. Mr. Robbins
considers them nourishing food.<a id="Marker_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="marker">398</a></p>

<p>Locusts are sometimes boiled at Wadinoon for food for
men and beasts.<a id="Marker_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="marker">399</a></p>

<p>The Arabs of Morocco, we learn from Mr. Jackson,
esteem Locusts a great delicacy; and, during the summer
of 1799 and the spring of 1800, after the plague had
almost depopulated Barbary, dishes of them were served
up at the principal repasts. Their usual way of dressing
these insects, was to boil them in water half an hour, then
sprinkle them with salt and pepper, and fry them, adding a
little vinegar. The body of the insect is only eaten, and
resembles, according to this gentleman, the taste of prawns.
For their stimulating qualities, the Moors prefer them to
pigeons. A person may eat a plateful of them containing
two or three hundred without any ill effects.<a id="Marker_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="marker">400</a> In another
place, however, Mr. Jackson says the poor people, when
obliged to live altogether on this kind of food, become meager
and indolent.<a id="Marker_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="marker">401</a></p>

<p>In Morocco, the price of provisions falls when the Locusts
have entered the neighborhood.<a id="Marker_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="marker">402</a></p>

<p>The authority of Capt. Riley is, that Locusts are esteemed
very good food by the Moors, Arabs, and Jews of Barbary,
who catch large numbers of them in their season, and throw
them, while alive and jumping, into a pan of boiling argan
oil, where they are allowed to remain, hissing and frying,
till their wings are burned off and their bodies sufficiently
cooked; they are then poured out and eaten. Riley says
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_123" title="123"></a><!--124.png-->
they resemble, in consistence and flavor, the yolks of hard-boiled
hens’ eggs.<a id="Marker_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="marker">403</a></p>

<p>Capt. Beechey tells us he saw many asses, heavily laden
with Locusts for food, driven into the town of Mesurata, in
Tripoli.<a id="Marker_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="marker">404</a></p>

<p>Barth, in Central Africa, saw whole calabashes filled with
roasted Locusts, which, he says, occasionally form a considerable
part of the food of the natives, particularly if their
grain has been destroyed by this plague, as they can then
enjoy not only the agreeable flavor of the dish, but also
take a pleasant revenge for the ravages of their fields.<a id="Marker_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="marker">405</a></p>

<p>Adanson, after describing an immense swarm of Locusts
that covered an extent of several leagues which he saw,
says the negroes of Gambia eat these insects, and have different
ways of dressing them&mdash;some pounding and boiling
them in milk, others only boiling them on coals.<a id="Marker_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="marker">406</a></p>

<p>Dr. Sparrman says the Hottentots rejoice greatly upon
the arrival of the Locusts, although they never fail to destroy
every particle of verdure on the ground. But, continues
the doctor, they make themselves ample amends for
this loss, for, seizing these marauding animals, they eat them
in such numbers as, in the space of a few days, to get visibly
fatter and in a better condition. The females are principally
eaten, especially when about to migrate, before they
are able to fly, when their wings are short and their bodies
heavy and distended with eggs. The soup prepared of
these is of a brown coffee color, and, when cooled, from the
eggs has a fat and greasy appearance.<a id="Marker_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="marker">407</a></p>

<p>Dr. Sparrman also relates a curious notion which the
Hottentots about the Visch River have with respect to the
origin of the Locusts: that they proceed from the good will
of a great master-conjurer a long way to the north, who,
having removed the stone from the mouth of a certain deep
pit, lets loose these insects in order to furnish them with
food.<a id="Marker_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="marker">408</a> This is not unlike the account, given by the author
of the Apocalypse, of the origin of the symbolical Locusts,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_124" title="124"></a><!--125.png-->
which are said to ascend upon an angel’s opening the pit of
the abyss.<a id="Marker_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="marker">409</a></p>

<p>The Korannas and Bushmen of the Cape save the Locusts
in large quantities, and grind them between two stones into
a kind of a meal, which they mix with fat and grease, and
bake in cakes. Upon this fare, says Mr. Fleming, they live
for months together, and chatter with the greatest joy as
soon as the Locusts are seen approaching.<a id="Marker_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="marker">410</a></p>

<p>Locusts in Madagascar are greatly esteemed by the natives
as food.<a id="Marker_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="marker">411</a></p>

<p>The account of the missionary Moffat differs somewhat
from and is much more complete than Mr. Fleming’s and
Dr. Sparrman’s. He says the natives of S. Africa embrace
every opportunity of gathering Locusts, which can be done
during the night. Whenever the cloud alights at a place
not very distant from a town, the inhabitants turn out with
sacks, and often with pack-oxen, gather loads, and return
next day with millions. The Locusts are then prepared for
eating by simple boiling, or rather steaming, as they are put
into a large pot with a little water, and covered closely up;
after boiling for a short time, they are taken out and spread
on mats in the sun to dry, when they are winnowed, something
like corn, to clear them of their legs and wings; and,
when perfectly dry, are put into sacks, or laid upon the
house floor in a heap. The natives eat them whole, adding
a little salt when they can obtain it, or pound them in a
wooden mortar; and, when they have reduced them to
something like meal, they mix them with a little water and
make a cold stir-about.</p>

<p>When Locusts abound, the natives become quite fat, and
would even reward any old lady who would say that she
had coaxed them to alight within reach of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Mr. Moffat thinks the Locust not bad food, and, when
well fed, almost as good as shrimps.<a id="Marker_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="marker">412</a></p>

<p>The plan of gathering Locusts by night is occasionally
attended with danger. “It has happened that in gathering
them people have been bitten by venomous reptiles. On
one occasion a woman had been traveling for several miles
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_125" title="125"></a><!--126.png-->
with a large bundle of Locusts on her head, when a serpent,
which had been put into the sack with them, found its way
out. The woman, supposing it to be a thong dangling about
her shoulders, laid hold of it with her hand, and, feeling that
it was alive, instantly precipitated the bundle to the ground
and fled.”<a id="Marker_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="marker">413</a></p>

<p>Pringle, in his song of the wild Bushman, has the following
lines:</p>


<div class="poem">

<p>Flights of Locusts are considered so much of a blessing in
South Africa, that, as Dr. Livingstone states, the <em>rain</em>-doctors
sometimes promised to bring them by their incantations.<a id="Marker_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="marker">415</a></p>

<p>Carsten Niebuhr says that all Arabians, whether living in
their own country or in Persia, Syria, and Africa, are accustomed
to eat Locusts. They distinguish several species
of insect, to which they give particular names. The red
Locust, which is esteemed fatter and more succulent than
any other, and accordingly the greatest delicacy, they call
<i>Muken;</i> another is called <i>Dubbe</i>, but they abstain from it
because it has a tendency to produce diarrhœa. A light-colored
Locust, as well as the Muken, is eaten.</p>

<p>In Arabia, Locusts, when caught, are put in bags, or on
strings, to be dried; in Barbary, they are boiled, and then
dried upon the roofs of the houses. The Bedouins of
Egypt roast them alive, and devour them with the utmost
voracity. Niebuhr says he saw no instance of unwholesomeness
in this article of food; but Mr. Forskal was told
it had a tendency to thicken the blood and bring on melancholy
habits. The former gentleman also says the Jews in
Arabia are convinced that the fowls, of which the Israelites
ate so largely of in the desert, were only clouds of Locusts,
and laugh at our translators, who have supposed that they
found quails where quails never were.<a id="Marker_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="marker">416</a></p>

<p>The wild Locusts upon which St. John fed have given rise
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_126" title="126"></a><!--127.png-->
to great discussion&mdash;some authors asserting them to be the
fruit of the carob-tree, while others maintain they were the
true Locusts, and refer to the practice of the Arabs in Syria
at the present day. “They who deny insects to have been
the food of this holy man,” says Hasselquist, “urge that
this insect is an unaccustomary and unnatural food; but
they would soon be convinced of the contrary, if they would
travel hither, to Egypt, Arabia, or Syria, and take a meal
with the Arabs. Roasted Locusts are at this time eaten by
the Arabs, at the proper season, when they can procure
them; so that in all probability this dish has been used in
the time of St. John. Ancient customs are not here subject
to many changes, and the victuals of St. John are not
believed unnatural here; and I was assured by a judicious
Greek priest that their church had never taken the word in
any other sense, and he even laughed at the idea of its being
a bird or a plant.”<a id="Marker_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="marker">417</a></p>

<p>Mr. Forbes incidentally remarks that in Persia and Arabia,
roasted Locusts are sold in the markets, and eaten with
rice and dates, and sometimes flavored with salt and spices.<a id="Marker_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="marker">418</a></p>

<p>The <i>Acridites lincola</i> (<i>Gryllus Ægypticus</i> of Linnæus)
is the species commonly sold for food in the markets of
Bagdad.</p>

<p>In fact, Locusts have been eaten in Arabia from the remotest
antiquity. This is evinced by the sculptured slabs
found by Layard at Kouyunjic; for, among other attendants
carrying fruit, flowers, and game, to a banquet, are seen
several bearing dried Locusts fastened on rods. And being
thus introduced in this bas-relief among the choicest delicacies,
it is most probable they were also highly prized by
the Assyrians. Layard has figured one of these Locust
bearers, who upon the sculptured slab is about four and a
half feet in height.<a id="Marker_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="marker">419</a></p>

<p>The Chinese regard the Locust, when deprived of the
abdomen, and properly cooked, as passable eating, but do
not appear to hold the dish in much estimation.<a id="Marker_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="marker">420</a></p>

<p>Mr. Laurence Oliphant, in Tientsin, China, saw bushels
of fried Locusts hawked about in baskets by urchins in the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_127" title="127"></a><!--128.png-->
streets. Locust-hunting, he asserts, was a favorite and
profitable occupation among the juvenile part of the community.
He thought the taste not unlike that of periwinkle.<a id="Marker_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="marker">421</a></p>

<p>Williams says: “The insect food (of the Chinese) is confined
to Locusts and Grasshoppers, Ground-grubs and Silk-worms;
the latter are fried to a crisp when cooked.”<a id="Marker_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="marker">422</a></p>

<p>Dampier says in the Bashee (Philippine) Islands, Locusts
are eaten as a regular food. The natives catch them in
small nets, when they come to devour their potato-vines,
and parch them over the fire in an earthen pan. When thus
prepared the legs and wings fall off, and the heads and backs,
which before were brownish, turn red like boiled shrimps.
Dampier once ate of this dish, and says he liked it well
enough. When their bodies were full they were moist to
the palate, but their heads cracked in his teeth.<a id="Marker_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="marker">423</a></p>

<p>Ovalle states that in the pampas of Chili, bread is made
of Locusts and of Mosquitos.<a id="Marker_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="marker">424</a></p>

<p>According to Mr. Jules Remy, our Western Indians eat
in great quantities what are generally there called <i>Crickets</i>,
the <i>Œdipoda corallipes</i>.<a id="Marker_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="marker">425</a></p>

<p>In the southern parts of France, M. Latrielle informs us,
the children are very fond of the fleshy thighs of Locusts.<a id="Marker_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="marker">426</a></p>

<p>The Arabs believe the Locusts have a government among
themselves similar to that of the bees and ants; and when
“Sultan Jeraad,” King of the Locusts, rises, the whole mass
follow him, and not a solitary straggler is left behind to
witness the devastation. Mr. Jackson himself evidently
believed this from the manner he has narrated it.<a id="Marker_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="marker">427</a> An Arab
once asserted to this gentleman, that he himself had seen
the great “Sultan Jeraad,” and described his lordship as
being larger and more beautifully colored than the ordinary
Locust.<a id="Marker_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="marker">428</a></p>

<p>Capt. Riley also mentions that each flight of Locusts is
said to have a king which directs its movements with great
regularity.<a id="Marker_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="marker">429</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_128" title="128"></a><!--129.png-->

<p>The Chinese believe the same, and affirm that this leader
is the largest individual of the whole swarm.<a id="Marker_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="marker">430</a></p>

<p>Benjamin Bullifant, in his observations on the Natural
History of New England, says: “The Locusts have a kind
of regimental discipline, and as it were commanders, which
show greater and more splendid wings than the common
ones, and arise first when pursued by fowls, or the feet of a
traveler, as I have often seriously remarked.”<a id="Marker_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="marker">431</a></p>

<p>The truth, however, is found in the Bible. They have no
king.<a id="Marker_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="marker">432</a></p>

<p>The Saharawans, or Arabs of the desert, “whose hands
are against every man,”<a id="Marker_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="marker">433</a> and who rejoice in the evil that
befalls other nations, when they behold the clouds of Locusts
proceeding toward the north are filled with the greatest
gladness, anticipating a general mortality, which they call
<i>El-khere</i>, the good, or the benediction; for, when Barbary
is thus laid waste, they emerge from their arid recesses in
the desert and pitch their tents in the desolated plains.<a id="Marker_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="marker">434</a></p>

<p>Pausanias tells us, that in the temple of Parthenon there
was a brazen statue of Apollo, by the hand of Phidias, which
was called Parnopius, out of gratitude for that god having
once banished from that country the Locusts, which greatly
injured the land. The same author asserts that he himself
has known the Locusts to have been thrice destroyed by
Apollo in the Mountain Lipylus, once exterminating them
by a violent wind; at another time by vehement heat; and
the third time by unexpected cold.<a id="Marker_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="marker">435</a></p>

<p>At a time when there were great swarms of Locusts in
China, as we learn from Navarette, the Emperor went out
into his gardens, and taking up some of these insects in his
hands, thus spoke to them: The people maintain themselves
on wheat, rice, etc., you come to devour and destroy it,
without leaving anything behind; it were better you should
devour my bowels than the food of my subjects. Having
concluded his speech, the monarch was about to put them in
a fair way of “devouring his bowels” by swallowing them,
when some that stood by telling him they were venomous,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_129" title="129"></a><!--130.png-->
he nobly answered, “I value not my life when it is for the
good of my subjects and people to lose it,” and immediately
swallowed the insects. History tells us the Locusts that
very moment took wing, and went off without doing any
more damage; but whether or not the heroic Emperor
recovered leaves us in ignorance.<a id="Marker_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="marker">436</a></p>

<p>Mr. J.&nbsp;M. Jones gives the following ludicrous account of
the capture of a Locust in the Bermudas. While walking
one hot day in the vicinity of the barracks at St. George’s,
with his lamented friend, the late Col. Oakly (56th Regt.),
on the lookout for insects, a very fine specimen of the
Locust sprung up before them. The former chased it for a
while unavailingly, but determined not to be balked of his
prey; the colonel then joined in the pursuit, and after a
sharp and hot chase, bagged his game right before a sentry-box;
the sentry, as in duty bound, standing with arms presented,
in the presence of a field officer, who was, however,
in a rather undignified position to receive the salute. They
had gained their prize, however, and had a hearty laugh, in
which we fancy the sentry could scarcely help joining.<a id="Marker_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="marker">437</a></p>

<p>Capt. Drayson, in his South African Sporting, tells the
following anecdote: A South African, riding through a
flock of Locusts, was struck in the eye by one of them, and,
though blinded momentarily in the injured eye, he still kept
the other on the insect, which sought to escape by diving
among the crowd on the ground. So, dismounting, he captured
it, passed a large pin through its body, and thrust it
in his waistcoat pocket; and whenever the damaged eye
smarted, he pulled it out again, and stuck the pin through
it in a fresh place.<a id="Marker_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="marker">438</a></p>

<p>Darwin tells us that when the “Beagle” was to windward
of the Cape de Verd Islands, and when the nearest point of
land, not directly opposed to the trade-wind, was Cape
Blanco on the coast of Africa, 370 miles distant, a large
Grasshopper&mdash;<i>Acrydium</i>&mdash;flew on board!<a id="Marker_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="marker">439</a> But Sir Hans
Sloane mentions a much more remarkable flight in his History
of Jamaica; for when the Assistance frigate was about
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_130" title="130"></a><!--131.png-->
300 leagues to windward of Barbados, he says a Locust
alighted on the forecastle among the sailors!<a id="Marker_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="marker">440</a></p>

<p>Several species of Locusts are beautifully marked; these
were sought after by young Jewish children as playthings.<a id="Marker_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="marker">441</a></p>

<p>The eggs of the <i>Chargol</i> Locust, <i>Truxalis nasuta?</i>, the
Jewish women used to carry in their ears to preserve them
from the earache.<a id="Marker_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="marker">442</a></p>

<p>The word <i>Locust</i>, Latin <i>Locusta</i>, is derived by the old
etymologists from <i>locus</i>, a place, and <i>ustus</i>, burned,&mdash;“quod
tactu multa <i>urit</i> morsu vero omnia erodat.” True
Locusts are the <i>Acridium</i>, or <i>Criquets</i>, of Geoffroy, and
the <i>Gryllus</i> of Fabricius. The Migratory-locust, <i>Locusta
migratoria</i>, a rather small insect, is the most celebrated
species of the family. To it almost all the devastations
before mentioned have been attributed. It is most probable,
however, many species have been confounded under the same
name.</p>

<p>In Spain, as we are told by Osbeck, the people of fashion
keep a species of Locust&mdash;called there <i>Gryllo</i>&mdash;in cages&mdash;<i>grillaria</i>,&mdash;for
the sake of its song.<a id="Marker_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="marker">443</a> De Pauw says that,
like Canary birds, they were kept in cages to sing during
the celebration of mass.<a id="Marker_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="marker">444</a></p>

<p>The song of a Spanish Gryllo on one occasion, if we may
credit the historian, was the means of saving a vessel from
shipwreck. The incident evinces the perilous situation of
Cabeza de Vara, in his voyage toward Brazil, and is related
by Dr. Southey in his history of that country as follows:</p>

<p>“When they had crossed the Line, the state of the water
was inquired into, and it was found, that of a hundred casks
there remained but three, to supply four hundred men and
thirty horses. Upon this, the Adelantado gave orders to
make for the nearest land. Three days they stood toward
it. A soldier, who had set out in ill health, had brought a
Gryllo, or ground cricket, with him from Cadiz, thinking to
be amused by the insect’s voice; but it had been silent the
whole way, to his no little disappointment. Now, on the
fourth morning, the Gryllo began to sing its shrill rattle,
scenting, as it was immediately supposed, the land. Such
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_131" title="131"></a><!--132.png-->
was the miserable watch which had been kept, that upon
looking out at the warning, they perceived high rocks within
bowshot; against which, had it not been for the insect, they
must inevitably have been lost. They had just time to drop
anchor. From hence they coasted along, the Gryllo singing
every night, as if it had been on shore, till they reached
the Island of St. Catalina.”<a id="Marker_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="marker">445</a></p>

<p>To account for the singular sound produced by the <i>Platyphyllon
concavum</i>, which much resembles the expression
<i>Katy did</i>, so much so that the insect is now called the Katy-did,&mdash;a
curious legend is told in this country, and particularly
in Virginia and Maryland. Mrs. A.&nbsp;L. Ruter Dufour
has kindly embodied it in the following verses for me:</p>


<div class="poem">

<div class="line i2">  Once in the far-off days of olden time:</div>

<h2 id="ORDER_IV">ORDER IV.<br />

<span class="subtitle">NEUROPTERA.</span></h2>


<h3 id="Termitidae_White-ants">Termitidæ&mdash;White-ants.</h3>

<p>The Termites or White-ants (which are <em>ants</em> only by a
misnomer) are found in both the Indies, in Africa, and in
South America, where they do vast damage, in consequence
of their eating and perforating wooden buildings, utensils,
furniture, and indeed all kinds of household stuff, which are
utterly destroyed by them if not timely prevented. They
are found also in Europe, and, about thirty years ago, from
the extent of their ravages in the West of France, and particularly
at Rochelle, caused considerable alarm.<a id="Marker_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="marker">446</a></p>

<p>There is a story commonly told, if not commonly credited
throughout India, of the Termites demolishing a chest of
dollars at Bencoolen, which is in a great degree cleared up
by the following anecdote introduced by Mr. Forbes in his
Memoirs: A gentleman having charge of a chest of money,
unfortunately placed it on the floor in a damp situation;
and, as a matter of course in that climate, the box was
speedily attacked by the Termites, which had their burrow
just under the place the treasure stood. Soon annihilating
the bottom, these devouring insects were not any more
ceremonious in respect to the bags containing the specie;
which, being thus let loose, fell piece by piece gradually into
the hollows in the Termites’ burrow. When the cash was
demanded, and not to be found, all were greatly amazed at
the wonderful powers, both of teeth and stomachs, of the
little marauders, which were supposed to have consumed
the silver and gold as well as the wood. But, after some
years, however, the house requiring repair, the whole sum
was found several feet deep in the earth; and, thanks, the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_133" title="133"></a><!--134.png-->
Termites were rescued from that obloquy which the supposed
power of feasting on precious metals had cast on their
whole race.<a id="Marker_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="marker">447</a></p>

<p>Kempfer, during his stay at a Dutch fort on the coast of
Malabar, one morning discovered some peculiar marks like
arches upon his table, about the size of his little finger.
Suspecting they were the work of Termites, he made an accurate
examination, and, much to his surprise, found not
only what he expected to be true, but that these voracious
insects had pierced a passage of that thickness up one leg
of the table, then across the table, and so down again
through the middle of another leg into the floor! What
made it the more wonderful was that it had all been done in
the few hours that intervened between his retiring to rest
and his rising.<a id="Marker_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="marker">448</a></p>

<p>Mr. Forbes, on surveying a room which had been locked
up during an absence of a few weeks, observed a number of
advanced works in various directions toward some prints
and drawings in English frames; the glasses appeared to
be uncommonly dull, and the frames covered with dust.
“On attempting,” says he, “to wipe it off, I was astonished
to find the glasses fixed on the wall, not suspended in frames
as I left them, but completely surrounded by an incrustation
cemented by the White-ants, who had actually eaten up the
deal frames and back-boards, and the greater part of the
paper, and left the glasses upheld by the incrustation, or covered
way, which they had formed during their depredation.”<a id="Marker_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="marker">449</a></p>

<p>It is even asserted, says Kirby and Spence, that the superb
residence of the Governor-general at Calcutta, which
cost the East India Company such immense sums, is now
going rapidly to decay in consequence of the attacks of
these insects. But not content with the dominions they have
acquired, and the cities they have laid low on Terra Firma,
encouraged by success, the White-ants have also aimed at
the sovereignty of the ocean, and once had the hardihood
to attack even a British ship of the line&mdash;the Albion; and,
in spite of the efforts of her commander and his valiant crew,
having boarded they got possession of her, and handled her
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_134" title="134"></a><!--135.png-->
so roughly, that when brought into port, being no longer
fit for service, she was obliged to be broken up.<a id="Marker_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="marker">450</a></p>

<p>Lutfullah, in his Autobiography, relates the following:
“I returned the couch kindly sent to me by a friend, with
my thanks, and made my bed on the ground, placing my
new desk of Morocco leather at the head to serve as a pillow,
and went to bed. In the morning, when roused by the
bugle, I found my bed strewed with damp dust, my skin excoriated
in some parts, and my back irritated in others. I
called my servant, who was saddling my horse. ‘Mahdilli,’
said I angrily, ‘you have been throwing dust all over my
bed and self, in shaking the trappings of the horse near my
bed in the tent.’&mdash;‘No, sir, I have done no such thing,’ was
his reply. When I took up my cloak it fell to pieces in my
hand; the blanket was in the same state, and the bottom of
my desk, with some valuable papers, were destroyed. ‘What
misfortune is this?’ cried I to Mahdilli, who immediately
brought a burning stick to examine the cause, and coolly
observed, ‘It is the White-ants, sir, and no misfortune, but
a piece of bad luck, sir.’ Poor man! in all mishaps, I
always found him attaching blame to destiny, and never to
his own or my imprudence.”<a id="Marker_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="marker">451</a></p>

<p>The Caffres, as we are informed by Mr. Latrobe, when
first permitted to settle at Guadenthal, before they could
build ovens, according to the custom of their country, availed
themselves of the Ant-hills found in that neighborhood; for,
having destroyed the inhabitants by fire and smoke, they
scooped them out hollow, leaving a crust of a few inches in
thickness, and used them for baking, putting in three loaves
at a time.<a id="Marker_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="marker">452</a></p>

<p>Mr. Southey says that in Brazil the Spaniards hollow out
the nests of the Termites, and use them for ovens.<a id="Marker_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="marker">453</a> The
authority of Messrs. Kidder and Fletcher is, that in Brazil,
“the Termites’ dwelling is sometimes overturned by the
slaves, the hollow scooped wider, and is then used as a bake-oven
to parch Indian-corn.”<a id="Marker_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="marker">454</a></p>

<p>Mr. Latrobe also tells us that the clay of which these
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_135" title="135"></a><!--136.png-->
Ant-hills are formed, is so well prepared by the industrious
Termites, <i>Termes bellicosus</i>, that it is used for the floors
of rooms in South Africa both by the Hottentots and
farmers.<a id="Marker_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="marker">455</a></p>

<p>Mr. Southey states that in Brazil “the Spaniards pulverize
the nests of the Termites, and with the powder form
a flooring for their houses, which becomes as hard as stone,
and on which it is said no fleas or other insects will harbor.”<a id="Marker_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="marker">456</a>
The early Spanish settlers built the walls of their houses of
the same earth; and some of which, which were erected in
the seventeenth century, are said to be still in existence.<a id="Marker_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="marker">457</a></p>

<p>Ant-hills, or rather the Termites which inhabit them,
have also been used as an instrument of perhaps the most
infernal torture the ingenuity of man has ever invented.
For, in South Africa, at one time, the wretched victim,
whether prisoner of war or offending subject, having been
smeared with some oily substance, was partially interred in
one of these heaps, and, if not first roasted to death by the
burning sun, was literally devoured alive by the myriads of
insects which have their habitation there. It has been asserted
that even some Englishmen have met this dreadful
fate.<a id="Marker_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="marker">458</a></p>

<p>At Unyamwezi, in the lake regions of Central Africa,
the natives chew the clay of Ant-hills as a substitute when
their tobacco fails. They call this clay “sweet earth.” It
is said the Arabs have also tried it without other effects
than nausea.<a id="Marker_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="marker">459</a></p>

<p>The goldsmiths of Ceylon employ the powdered clay of
Ant-hills in preference to all other substances in the preparation
of crucibles and moulds for their fine castings, for so
delicate is the trituration to which the Termites subject this
material;<a id="Marker_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="marker">460</a> and Knox says, “the people use this finer clay
to make their earthen gods of, it is so pure and fine.”<a id="Marker_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="marker">461</a></p>

<p>Termites, as an article of food, are eaten by the inhabitants
of many countries. Mr. Kœnig, in his essay on the
history of these insects, read before the Society of Naturalists
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_136" title="136"></a><!--137.png-->
of Berlin, tells us, that to catch the Termites before
their emigration, the natives of the East Indies make two
holes in the nest, one to windward, and the other to leeward;
at the latter aperture, they place a pot, rubbed with aromatic
herbs. On the windward side they make a fire, the smoke
of which drives these insects into the pots. By this method
they take a great quantity, of which they make, with flour,
a variety of pastry, which they sell to the poorer people.
This author adds, that in the season in which this aliment
is abundant, the abuse of it produces an epidemic colic and
dysentery, which carries off the patient in two or three
hours.<a id="Marker_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="marker">462</a></p>

<p>The Africans, says Mr. Smeatham, are less ingenious in
catching and preparing them. They content themselves in
collecting those which fall into the water at the time of
emigration. They skim them off the surface with calabashes,
filling large caldrons with them, then grill them in iron
pots, over a gentle fire, stirring them as coffee is stirred.
They thus eat them by handfuls, without sauce, or any other
preparation, and find them delicious. This gentleman has
several times eaten them cooked in this manner, and thinks
them delicate, nourishing, and wholesome, being sweeter than
the grub of the palm-tree weevil (<i>Calandra palmarum</i>),
and resembling in taste sugared cream or sweet almond
paste.<a id="Marker_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="marker">463</a></p>

<p>The Hottentots, Dr. Sparrman informs us, eat them
greedily boiled and raw, and soon grow fat and plump upon
this food.<a id="Marker_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="marker">464</a></p>

<p>An idea may be formed of this dish by what once occurred
to Dr. Livingstone on the banks of the Zouga, in South
Africa. The Bayeiye chief Palani visiting this traveler while
eating, he gave him a piece of bread and preserved apricots;
and as the chief seemed to relish it much, he asked him if
he had any food equal to that in his country. “Ah!” said
the chief, “did you ever taste White-ants?” As the doctor
never had, he replied, “Well, if you had, you never could
have desired to eat anything better.”<a id="Marker_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="marker">465</a></p>

<p>In the lake regions of Central Africa, says Burton, man
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_137" title="137"></a><!--138.png-->
revenges himself upon the White-ant, and satisfies his
craving for animal food, which in those regions oftentimes
becomes a principle of action,&mdash;a passion,&mdash;by boiling the
largest and fattest species, and eating them as a relish with
his insipid porridge.<a id="Marker_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="marker">466</a></p>

<p>Buchanan says the Termes, or White-ant, is a common
article of food among one of the Hindoo tribes; Mr. Forbes
says, of the low castes in Mysore, and the Carnatic.<a id="Marker_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="marker">467</a> Captain
Green relates that, in the ceded districts of India, the
natives place the branches of trees over the nests, and then
by means of smoke drive out the insects; which attempting
to fly, their wings are broken off by the mere touch of the
branches.<a id="Marker_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="marker">468</a></p>

<p>The female Termite, in particular, is supposed by the
Hindoos to be endowed with highly nutritive properties,
and, we are told by Mr. Broughton, was carefully sought
after and preserved for the use of the debilitated Surjee
Rao, Prime-minister of Scindia, chief of the Mahrattas.<a id="Marker_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="marker">469</a></p>

<p>The Hottentots not only eat the Termites in their perfect
state, but also, when their corn is consumed and they are
reduced to the necessity, in their pupa. These pupæ, which
they call “rice,” on account of their resemblance to that
grain, they usually wash, and cook with a small quantity of
water. Prepared in this way they are said to be palatable;
and if the people find a place where they can obtain them
in abundance, they soon become fat upon them, even when
previously much reduced by hunger. A large nest will
sometimes yield a bushel of pupæ.<a id="Marker_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="marker">470</a></p>

<p>Termite queens in the East Indies are given alive to old
men for strengthening the back.<a id="Marker_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="marker">471</a></p>

<h3 id="Ephemeridae_Day-flies">Ephemeridæ&mdash;Day-flies.</h3>

<p>The name of Ephemeridæ has been given to the insects,
so called, in consequence of the short duration of their lives,
when they have acquired their final form. There are some
of them which never see the sun; they are born after it is set,
and die before it reappears on the horizon.</p>

<p>These insects, indifferently called also Day-flies and May-flies,
usually make their appearance in the districts watered
by the Seine and the Marne, in the month of August; and
in such countless myriads, that the fishermen of these rivers
believe they are showered down from heaven, and accordingly
call the living cloud of them <i>manna</i>&mdash;manna for fish, not
men. Reaumur once saw them descend in this region so
fast, that the step on which he stood by the river’s bank was
covered by a layer four inches thick in a few minutes. He
compares their falling to that of snow with the largest
flakes.<a id="Marker_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="marker">472</a></p>

<p>Scopoli assures us that such swarms are produced every
season in the neighborhood of some particular spots in the
Duchy of Carniola, that the countrymen think they obtain
but a small portion, unless every farmer can carry off about
twenty cartloads of them into his fields for the purpose of a
manure.<a id="Marker_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="marker">473</a></p>


<h3 id="Libellulidae_Dragon-flies">Libellulidæ&mdash;Dragon-flies.</h3>

<p>On account of the long and slender body, peculiar to the
insects of this family, they are with us sometimes called
<i>Devil’s Darning-needles</i>, but more commonly <i>Dragon-flies</i>.
In Scotland they are known by the name of <i>Flying Adders</i>,
for the same reason. The English, from an erroneous belief
that they sting horses, call them <i>Horse-stingers</i>. In France,
from their light and airy motions, and brilliant, variegated
dress, they are called <i>Demoiselles;</i> and in Germany, for the
same reason, and that they hover over, and lived during
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_139" title="139"></a><!--140.png-->
their first stages in, water, <i>Wasser-jungfern</i>&mdash;Virgins of the
Water. Another German name for them is <i>Florfliegen</i>&mdash;Gauze-flies,
in allusion to their net-like wings. Our boys
also call them <i>Snake-feeders</i> and <i>Snake-doctors</i>, in the belief
that they wait upon snakes in the capacity of feeders
and doctors; and so firm are they in this belief, that frequently
I have been laughed at for asserting the contrary
to them. The belief probably arose from the manner in
which the Dragon-fly sometimes falls a prey to the snakes.
Hovering over ponds, they are fond of alighting on little
sticks and twigs just out of the water, and mistaking the
heads of snakes, which probably swam there for the purpose,
for such twigs, they are instantly caught by the snakes.</p>

<p>On the 30th and 31st of May, 1839, immense cloud-like
swarms of Dragon-flies passed in rapid succession over the
German town of Weimar and its neighborhood. They were
the <i>Libellula depressa</i>, a species which, in general, is rather
scarce in that part of Germany. The general direction of
this migration was from south by west to north by east.
The insects were in a vigorous state, and some of the flocks
flew as high as 150 feet above the level of the River Ilm.</p>

<p>At Gottingen on June the 1st, at Eisenach on May the 30th
and 31st of the same year, swarms of the same species were
seen flying from east to west; and at Calais, June 14th,
similar clouds, though of a different species, were noticed
on their way toward the Netherlands. At Halle, also, on
May 30th, a short time before a thunder-storm, swarms of
the Dragon-fly, <i>L. quadrimaculata</i>, were seen by Dr. Buhle,
flying very rapidly from south to north. The <i>L. quadrimaculata</i>
is not generally found in the neighborhood of
Halle.</p>

<p>This wonderful migration, for it is a phenomenon of rare
occurrence, extended from the 51st to the 52d degree of
latitude, and was observed within 27° 40′ and 30° east of
Ferro. But the instance of Calais renders it probable that
it extended over a great part of Europe.</p>

<p>Another migration of Dragon-flies was observed at
Weimar on the 28th of June, 1816. The insects, in this
instance, belonged also to the <i>L. depressa</i>. They were
taken then, as were they also in 1839, for locusts by the
common people, and looked upon as the harbingers of famine
and war.</p>

<p>In these migrations they followed the direction of the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_140" title="140"></a><!--141.png-->
rivers, with the currents. They did not, however, always
keep close by them, since they must spread over wide districts
in order to subsist.</p>

<p>To account for the great multiplication of these insects, in
the year 1839, is by no means difficult. From the beginning
to the 21st of May (in the latter part of which month, it will
be remembered, they appeared), the weather had been exceedingly
rainy; rivers and lakes overflowed their banks
and inundated immense areas of low grounds, whereby
myriads of the <i>larvæ</i> and <i>pupæ</i> (which live entirely in
water) of the <i>Libellulæ</i>, which, under other circumstances,
would have remained in deep water, and become the prey of
their many enemies, fish, etc., were brought into shallow
water, and hot weather following, from May 21st to May
29th, converted these shallows and swamps into true hotbeds
for them. Their development into perfect insects was
thus rendered rapid, so that, somewhat earlier than usual,
they appeared, and in far greater, their undiminished, numbers;
and, being very voracious in their appetite, as well in
the imago as the pupa state, they were obliged to migrate
immediately to satisfy it.<a id="Marker_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="marker">474</a></p>

<p>Mr. Gosse observed in Jamaica, Oct. 8th, 1845, a swarm
of Dragon-flies in the air, about twenty feet from the level
of the ground. They floated and danced about, over the
stream of water that runs through Blue-fields, much in the
manner of gnats, which they resembled also in their immense
numbers.<a id="Marker_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="marker">475</a> And Rev. T.&nbsp;J. Bowen, on one occasion, in descending
the Ogun River (in the Yoruba country, Africa),
met millions of Dragon-flies, about one-fourth of an inch in
length, making their way up the country by following the
course of the stream.<a id="Marker_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="marker">476</a></p>

<p>It is commonly said among us, that if a Dragon-fly be
killed, there will soon be a death in the family of the killer.</p>

<h3 id="Myrmeleonidae_Ant-lions">Myrmeleonidæ&mdash;Ant-lions.</h3>

<p>When children meet with the funnel-shaped pitfalls of the
larva of the Ant-lion, <i>Myrmeleon formicales</i>, they are wont
to put their heads close to the ground and softly sing <i>ooloo-ooloo-ooloo</i>,
till the larva, mistaking the sound for that of a
fly escaping his trap, throws up a shower of sand to bring
its supposed victim down again.</p>

<p>Ant-lions are held in great esteem in many sections of our
country, so much so that they are not suffered to be in any
way injured.</p>

<h3 id="Uroceridae_Sirex">Uroceridæ&mdash;Sirex.</h3>

<p>In a work called “<i>Ephemerides des curieux de la nature</i>,”
is an observation apparently relative to this family of
insects, which, if true, would be very extraordinary indeed.
It is there said, that in the town of Czierck and its environs,
there were seen in 1679 some unknown winged insects which,
with their stings, mortally wounded both men and beasts.
They fell abruptly upon men without provocation, and attached
themselves to the naked parts of the body: the sting
was immediately followed by a hard tumor, and if care was
not taken of the wound within the first three hours, by hastily
extracting the poison from it, the patient died in a few days
after. These insects killed five and thirty men in this diocese,
and a great number of oxen and horses. Toward the
end of September, the winds brought some of them into a
small town on the confines of Silesia and Poland; but they
were so feeble on account of the cold, that they did but little
mischief there. Eight days after, they all disappeared.
These animals have all of them four wings, six feet, and
carry under the belly a long sting provided with a sheath,
which opens and separates in two. They make a very sharp
noise in attacking men. Some of them are ornamented with
yellow circles (<i>Sirex gigas</i>, or <i>S. fusicornis?</i> M. Latreille),
and others are similar to them in all respects, but they have
the back altogether black, and their stings are more venomous
(<i>S. spectrum</i> or <i>juvencus?</i>). The author of these observations
gives an extended description of the species with the
yellow circles, which he accompanies with figures, in which
the character of <i>Sirex</i> may be clearly distinguished.<a id="Marker_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="marker">477</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_143" title="143"></a><!--144.png-->


<h3 id="Cynipidae_Gall-flies">Cynipidæ&mdash;Gall-flies.</h3>

<p>In the spring of 1694, some Galls hung down like chains
upon the oaks in Germany, and the common people, who
had never observed them before, imagined them to be magical
knots.<a id="Marker_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="marker">478</a></p>

<p>A very old and common superstition is, that every oak-apple
contains either a maggot, a fly, or a spider: the first
foretelling famine, the second war, and the third, the spider,
pestilence. Matthiolus gravely affirms this conceit to be
true;<a id="Marker_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="marker">479</a> and the learned Sir Thomas Browne, in his Pseudodoxia
Epidemica, has thought it worth his while, with much
gravity, to explode it. He, however, while combating one
popular error, falls himself into another, for want of that
philosophical knowledge of insects which later times have
succeeded in obtaining. We pass this by, and hurry to his
conclusion: “We confess the opinion may hold some verity
in analogy, or emblematical phancy; for pestilence is properly
signified by the spider, whereof some kinds are of a
very venomous nature: famine by maggots, which destroy
the fruits of the earth; and war not improperly by the fly, if
we rest in the phancy of Homer, who compares the valiant
Grecian unto a fly. Some verity it may also have in itself, as
truly declaring the corruptive constitution in the present
sap and nutrimental juice of the tree; and may consequently
discover the disposition of the year according to
the plenty or kinds of those productions; for if the putrefying
juices of bodies bring forth plenty of flies and maggots,
they give forth testimony of common corruption, and declare
that the elements are full of the seeds of putrefaction, as the
great number of caterpillars, gnats, and ordinary insects do
also declare. If they run into spiders, they give signs of
higher putrefaction, as plenty of vipers and scorpions are
confessed to do; the putrefying materials producing animals
of higher mischief according to the advance and higher
strain of corruption.”<a id="Marker_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="marker">480</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_144" title="144"></a><!--145.png-->

<p>Moufet says: “In oak acorns and spongy apples sometimes
worms breed, and astrologers presage that year to be
likely to produce a great famine and dearth.… It is
strange that Ringelbergius writes, <i>lib. de experiment</i>, that
these worms may be fed to be as big as a serpent, with
sheep’s milk; yet Cardanus confirms the same, and shewes the
way to feed them, <i>Lib. de rer. varietat</i>.”<a id="Marker_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="marker">481</a></p>

<p>There is a very curious operation performed at the present
day in the Levant with one of these Gall-flies, which is
termed <i>caprification</i>. The object of it is to hasten the maturity
of figs; and the species employed for that purpose is
the <i>Cynips ficus caricæ</i>, or <i>Cynips psenes</i> of Linnæus; it
consists in placing on a fig-tree, which does not produce
flowers or early figs, some of these last strung together with
a thread. The insects which issue from them, full of fecundating
dust, introduce themselves through the eye into the
interior of the second figs, fecundate by this means all the
grains, and provoke the ripening of the fruit.</p>

<p>This operation, of which some authors have spoken with
admiration, appeared to Hasselquist and Olivier, both competent
observers, who have been on the spot, to be of no
advantage whatsoever in fertilizing the fig;<a id="Marker_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="marker">482</a> and scientific
men of the present day generally hold that it cannot be of
any utility, for each fig contains some small flowers toward
the eye, capable of fecundating all the female flowers in the
interior, and moreover this fruit will grow, ripen, and become
excellent to eat even when the grains are not fecundated.<a id="Marker_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="marker">483</a></p>

<p>A curious kind of gall, produced on the rose-trees by the
<i>Cynips rosæ</i>, which is known by the name of <i>Bedeguar</i>,
has been placed among the remedies which may be successfully
employed against diarrhœa and dysentery, and useful
in cases of scurvy, stone, and worms.<a id="Marker_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="marker">484</a></p>

<p>The galls of commerce, commonly called <i>Nut-galls</i>, are
found on the <i>Quercus infectoria</i>, a species of oak growing
in the Levant, and are produced by the <i>Cynips Gallæ
tinctorum</i>. When gathered before the insects quit them,
the nut-galls contain more astringent matter, and are then
known as Black, Blue, or Green-galls. When the insects
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_145" title="145"></a><!--146.png-->
have escaped, they are less astringent, and are called White-galls.
They are of great importance in the arts, being very
extensively used in dyeing and in the manufacture of ink
and leather. They are the most powerful of all the vegetable
astringents, and are sometimes used, both internally and
externally, with great effect in medicine. Those imported
from Syria are the most esteemed, and, of these, those
found in the neighborhood of Moussoul are considered the
best.<a id="Marker_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="marker">485</a></p>

<p>The gall of the field cirsium formerly enjoyed a very
great reputation, for it was considered, when carried simply
in the pocket, as a sovereign remedy against hemorrhages.
It, no doubt, owed this virtue to its resemblance to the principal
sign of this disease, the swelling of the vein.<a id="Marker_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="marker">486</a></p>

<p>The galls of the ground-ivy, produced by the <i>Cynips
glecome</i>, have been eaten as food in France; they have an
agreeable taste, and to a high degree the odor of the plant
which bears them. Reaumur, however, is doubtful whether
they will ever rank with good fruits.<a id="Marker_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="marker">487</a></p>

<p>The galls of the sage (<i>Salvia pomifera</i>, <i>S. triloba</i>, and
<i>S. officinalis</i>), which are very juicy, like apples, and crowned
with rudiments of leaves resembling the calyx of that fruit,
are gathered every year, as an article of food, by the inhabitants
of the Island of Crete. This is the statement
of Poumefort. Olivier confirms it, and adds: They are
esteemed in the Levant for their aromatic and acid flavor,
especially when prepared with honey and sugar, and form a
considerable article of commerce from Scio to Constantinople,
where they are regularly exposed in the market.<a id="Marker_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="marker">488</a></p>

<p>The celebrated “Dead Sea Fruits,” often called <i>Poma
insana</i>, or Mad-apples, <i>Mala Sodomitica</i>, etc., which have
given rise to great controversy among Oriental scholars and
Biblical commentators, are produced by the <i>Cynips insana</i>
on the low oaks (<i>Quercus infectoria</i>) growing on
the borders of the Dead Sea.<a id="Marker_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="marker">489</a></p>

<h3 id="Formicidae_Ants">Formicidæ&mdash;Ants.</h3>

<p>Herodotus, who wrote in the fifth century before the birth
of Christ, tells the following fabulous story without the
slightest trace of diffidence or disbelief: There are other
Indians bordering on the City of Caspatyrus and the country
of Pactyica, settled northward of the other Indians, whose
mode of life resembles that of the Bactrians. They are the
most warlike of the Indians, and these are they who are
sent to procure the gold; for near this part is a desert by
reason of the sand. In this desert then, and in the sand,
there are Ants in size somewhat less indeed than dogs, but
larger than foxes. Some of them are in the possession of
the King of the Persians, which were taken there. These
Ants, forming their habitations under ground, heap up the
sand as the Ants in Greece do, and in the same manner; and
they are very like them in shape. The sand that is heaped
up is mixed with gold. The Indians, therefore, go to the
desert to get this sand, each man having three camels, on
either side a male one harnessed to draw by the side, and a
female in the middle; this last the man mounts himself, having
taken care to yoke one that has been separated from her
young as recently as possible; for camels are not inferior to
horses in swiftness, and are much better able to carry burdens.…
The Indians then, adopting such a plan and
such a method of harnessing, set out for the gold, having
before calculated the time, so as to be engaged in their plunder
during the hottest part of the day, for during the heat
the Ants hide themselves under ground.… When the
Indians arrive at the spot, having sacks with them, they
fill these with the sand, and return with all possible expedition;
for the Ants, as the Persians say, immediately discovering
them by the smell, pursue them, and they are equaled
in swiftness by no other animal, so that if the Indians did
not get the start of them while the Ants were assembling,
not a man of them could be saved. Now the male camels
(for they are inferior in speed to the females) slacken their
pace, dragging on, not both equally; but the females, mindful
of the young they have left, do not slacken their pace.
Thus the Indians, as the Persians say, obtain the greatest
part of their gold.<a id="Marker_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="marker">490</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_147" title="147"></a><!--148.png-->

<p>Concerning these remarkable Ants, Strabo and Arrian
have preserved the statement of Megasthenes, who traveled
in India about two centuries later than the time of Herodotus.
As given by Strabo, who is somewhat more particular
in his story than Arrian, it is as follows: Megasthenes,
speaking of the Myrmeces (or Ants), says, among the Derdæ,
a populous nation of the Indians, living toward the East
and among the mountains, there was a mountain plain of
about 3000 stadia in circumference; that below this plain
were mines containing gold, which the Myrmeces, in size
not less than foxes, dig up. They are excessively fleet, and
subsist on what they catch. In winter they dig holes and
pile up the earth in heaps, like moles, at the mouths of the
openings. The gold dust which they obtain requires little
preparation by fire. The neighboring people go after it by
stealth with beasts of burden; for if it is done openly, the
Myrmeces fight furiously, pursuing those that run away, and,
if they seize them, kill them and the beasts. In order to
prevent discovery, they place in various parts pieces of the
flesh of wild beasts, and when the Myrmeces are dispersed
in various directions, they take away the gold dust, and, not
being acquainted with the mode of smelting it, dispose of
it in its rude state at any price to merchants.<a id="Marker_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="marker">491</a></p>

<p>Nearchus says he has himself seen several of the skins of
these Ants, which were as large as the skins of leopards.
They were brought by the Macedonian soldiers into Alexander’s
camp.<a id="Marker_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="marker">492</a></p>

<p>Pliny, as a matter of course, believed this marvelous
story, and has inserted it in brief in his compilation of natural
history. He adds, too, that in his time there were suspended
in the temple of Hercules, at Erythræ, this Ant’s
horns, which were looked upon as quite miraculous for
their size. He also informs us it was of the color of a cat.<a id="Marker_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="marker">493</a></p>

<p>Strabo and Arrian, from the manner in which they refer
to the statements of Megasthenes and Nearchus, no doubt
disbelieved them;<a id="Marker_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="marker">494</a> not so, however, Pomponius Mela.<a id="Marker_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="marker">495</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_148" title="148"></a><!--149.png-->

<p>M. de Veltheim thinks this animal, which, as Pliny says,
“has the color of a cat, and is in size as large as an Egyptian
wolf,” is nothing more than, and really is, the <i>Canis
corsac</i>, the small fox of India, and that by some mistake it
was represented by travelers as an ant. It is not improbable,
Cuvier says, that some quadruped, in making holes
in the ground, may have occasionally thrown up some
grains of the precious metal. Another interpretation of
this story has also been suggested. We find some remarks
of Mr. Wilson, in the <i>Transactions of the Asiatic Society</i>,
on the Mahabharata, a Sanscrit poem, that various tribes
on the mountains Meru and Mandara (supposed to lie between
Hindostan and Thibet) used to sell grains of gold,
which they called <i>paippilaka</i>, or <i>Ant-gold</i>, which, they said,
was thrown up by Ants, in Sanscrit called <i>pippilaka</i>. In
traveling westward, this story (in itself, no doubt, untrue)
may very probably have been magnified to its present dimensions.<a id="Marker_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="marker">496</a></p>

<p>The laborious life and foresight of the Ant have been
celebrated throughout all antiquity, and from the wise Solomon
down to the amiable La Fontaine, the sluggard has
been referred to this insect to “learn her ways and be wise.”<a id="Marker_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="marker">497</a>
The Arabians held the wisdom of these animals in such estimation,
that they used to place one of them in the hands of
a newly-born infant, repeating these words: “May the boy
turn out clever and skillful.”<a id="Marker_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="marker">498</a> But their wisdom is magnified
by all, and in the panegyrics of their providence we always
find the following curious notion. Plutarch, in his Land and
Water Creatures Compared, thus mentions it: “But that
which surpasseth all other prudence, policy, and wit, is their
(the Ants’) caution and prevention which they use, that their
wheat and other corn may not spurt and grow. For this
is certain, that dry it cannot continue alwayes, nor sound and
uncorrupt, but in time will wax soft, resolve into a milky
juice, when it turneth and beginneth to swell and chit;
for fear, therefore, that it become not a generative seed, and
so by growing, loose the nature and property of food for
their nourishment, <i>they gnaw that end thereof or head
where it is wont to spurt and bud forth</i>.”<a id="Marker_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="marker">499</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_149" title="149"></a><!--150.png-->

<p>The ancients, observing the Ants carry their pupæ, which
in shape, size, and color very much resemble a grain of
corn, and the ends of which they sometimes pull open to let
out the inclosed insect, no doubt mistook the one for the
other, and this action for depriving the grain of the embryo
of the plant.</p>

<p>Some modern writers, as Addison<a id="Marker_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="marker">500</a> and Pluche,<a id="Marker_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="marker">501</a> it is curious
to observe, have fallen into this ancient error; so ancient,
in fact, it is that some have supposed the Hebrew name
of the Ant to be derived from it.<a id="Marker_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="marker">502</a> Among the poets, Prior
asks:</p>

<p>There is an old Eastern proverb, that “what the Ant <i>collects</i>
in a year the monks eat up in a night,” which seems to
be founded on the supposition that the Ants provide themselves
with stores of food. Juvenal, also, observes, in his
Sixth Satire, that “after the example of the Ant, some
have learned to <i>provide</i> against cold and hunger.”<a id="Marker_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="marker">508</a></p>

<p>“Since, therefore,” says Moufet, “(to winde up all in a few
words) they (the Ants) are so exemplary for their great piety,
prudence, justice, valour, temperance, modesty, charity, friendship,
frugality, perseverance, industry and art; it is no wonder
that Plato, in Phædone, hath determined, that they who
without the help of philosophy have lead a civill life by custom
or from their own diligence, they had their souls from
Ants, and when they die they are turned to Ants again.
To this may be added the fable of the Myrmidons, who being
a people of Ægina, applied themselves to diligent labour in
tilling the ground, continual digging, hard toiling, and constant
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_151" title="151"></a><!--152.png-->
sparing, joyned with virtue, and they grew thereby so
rich, that they passed the common condition and ingenuity of
men, and Theogonis knew not how to compare them better
than to Pismires, that they were originally descended from
them, or were transformed into them, and as Strabo reports
they were therefore called Myrmidons. The Greeks relate
the history otherwise than other men do; namely, that
Jupiter was changed into a Pismire, and so deflowered
Eurymedusa, the mother of the Graces, as if he could no
otherwise deceive the best woman, then in the shape of the
best creature. Hence ever after was he called Pismire Jupiter,
or, Jupiter, King of Pismires.…</p>

<p>“They do better, in my opinion, who observe the Pismire,
and grow rich by following his manners in labor, industry,
rest, and study. We read of Midas that he was the richest
King of all the West, and when he was a boy, the Pismires
carryed grains of wheat into his mouth while he slept, and
so foreshowed without doubt that he should be endowed
with the Pismire’s prudence, and should by his labour and
frugality, gain so much riches, that he should be called the
Golden boy of fortune, and the Darling of prosperity.
<i>Ælianus.</i> And when the Ants did devour and eat up the
live serpent of Tiberius Cæsar, which he so dearly loved,
did they not thereby give him sufficient warning that he
should take heed to himself for fear of the multitude, by
whom he was afterwards cruelly murthered? <i>Suetonius.</i>”<a id="Marker_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="marker">509</a></p>

<p>Of the wars and battles of the Ants, now so familiar from
the writings of Huber and others, one of the oldest records
is that given by Æneas Sylvius, who afterward became Pope
Pius II., of an engagement contested with obstinacy by a
great and a small species, on the trunk of a pear-tree.
“This action,” he states, “was fought in the pontificate of
Eugenius the Fourth, in the presence of Nicholas Pistoriensis,
an eminent lawyer, who related the whole history of
the battle with the greatest fidelity.” Another engagement
of the same description is recorded by Olaus Magnus, as
having happened previous to the expulsion of Christiern
the Second, of Sweden, and the smallest species, having
been victorious, are said to have buried the bodies of their
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_152" title="152"></a><!--153.png-->
own soldiers that had been killed, while they left those of
their adversaries a prey to the birds.<a id="Marker_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="marker">510</a></p>

<p>Alexander Ross, in his Appendix to the Arcana Microcosmi,
p. 219, tells us: “That the cruel battels between the
Venetians and Insubrians, and that also between the Liegeois
and the Burgundians, in which about thirty thousand men
were slain, were presignified by a great combat between two
swarms of Emmets (Ants).”<a id="Marker_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="marker">511</a></p>

<p>Ants were used in divination by the Greeks, and generally
foretold good.<a id="Marker_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="marker">512</a> They were also considered an attribute
of Ceres.<a id="Marker_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="marker">513</a></p>

<p>The following extract is from an English North-Country
chap-book, entitled the Royal Dream Book: “To dream of
Ants or Bees denotes that you will live in a great town or
city, or in a large family, and that you will be industrious,
happy, well married, and have a large family.”<a id="Marker_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="marker">514</a> The Ant
and the Bee are common figures to express these predictions.</p>

<p>I heard a mother once say to her child, “Never destroy
Ants, for they are fairies, and will so bewitch our cows that
they will give no milk.” This superstition prevails in particular
about Washington and in Virginia.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meer Hassan Ali, in an interesting article on the
Ants of India, remarks that she has often witnessed the
Hindoos, male and female, depositing small portions of
sugar near Ants’ nests as acts of charity to commence the
day with.</p>

<p>With the natives of India, this lady also tells us, it is a
common opinion that wherever the Red-ants colonize, prosperity
attends the owner of that house.<a id="Marker_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="marker">515</a></p>

<p>We read in Purchas’s <i>Pilgrims</i>, that “the natives of
Cambaia and Malabar will go out of the path if they light
on an Ant-hill, lest they might happily treade on some of
them.”<a id="Marker_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="marker">516</a></p>

<p>Other insects, as will be noticed in the course of this
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_153" title="153"></a><!--154.png-->
volume, are looked upon by these people with the same
respect.</p>

<p>Moufet says: “In Isthmus the priests sacrificed Pismires
to the sun, either because they thought the sun the most
beautiful, and therefore they would offer unto him the most
beautiful creature, or the most wise, as seeing all things,
and therefore they offered unto him the wisest creature.”<a id="Marker_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="marker">517</a></p>

<p>In the twenty-seventh chapter of the Koran, which was
revealed at Mecca, and entitled the Ant, we find, among
other strange things, an odd story of the Ant, which has
therefore given name to the chapter. It is as follows: “And
his armies were gathered together unto Solomon, consisting
of genii, and men, and birds; and they were led in distant
bands, until they came to the valley of Ants.<a id="Marker_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="marker">518</a> And an Ant,
seeing the hosts approaching, said, O Ants, enter ye into
your habitations, lest Solomon and his army tread you under
foot, and perceive it not. And Solomon smiled, laughing
at her words, and said, O Lord, excite me that I may be
thankful for thy favour, wherewith thou hast favoured me,
and my parents; and that I may do that which is right, and
well pleasing unto thee: and introduce me, through thy
mercy, into paradise, among my servants, the righteous.”<a id="Marker_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="marker">519</a></p>

<p>Thevenot mentions “Solomon’s Ant” among the “Beasts
that shall enter into Paradise” in the belief of the Turks,
and gives the following reason: “Solomon was the greatest
king that ever was, for all creatures obey’d him, and brought
him presents, amongst others, an Ant brought him a Locust,
which it had dragged along by main force: Solomon, perceiving
that the Ant had brought a thing bigger than itself,
accepted the present, and preferred it before all other creatures.”<a id="Marker_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="marker">520</a></p>

<p>Plutarch, speaking of the Ant, says: “Aratus in his prognostics
setteth this down for a rain toward, when they bring
forth their seeds and grains (pupæ), and lay them abroad to
take the air:</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_154" title="154"></a><!--155.png-->


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">‘When Ants make haste with all their eggs aload,</div>
<div class="line">Forth of their holes to carry them abroad.’”<a id="Marker_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="marker">521</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the Treasvrie of Avncient and Moderne Times, it is
also asserted that “when Ants walk the thickest, and more
than in vsuall numbers, meeting together confusedly, it is a
manifest signe of raine.”<a id="Marker_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="marker">522</a></p>

<p>It is related of the celebrated Timour, that being once
forced to take shelter from his enemies in a ruined building,
he sat alone many hours; and, desirous of diverting his mind
from his hopeless condition, at length fixed his observation
upon an Ant which was carrying a grain of corn (probably
a pupa) larger than itself, up a high wall. Numbering the
efforts it made to accomplish this object, he found that the
grain fell sixty-nine times to the ground; but the seventieth
time it reached the top of the wall. “This sight,” said
Timour, “gave me courage at the moment, and I have never
forgotten the lesson it conveyed.”<a id="Marker_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="marker">523</a></p>

<p>Plutarch, in his comparison between land and water creatures,
narrates the following anecdote: “Gleanthus the
Philosopher, although he maintaineth not that beasts have
any use of reason, made report nevertheless that he was
present at the sight of such a spectacle and occurrent as
this. There were (quoth he) a number of Ants which went
toward another Ant’s hole, that was not their own, carrying
with them the corpse of a dead Ant; out of which hole,
there came certain other Ants to meet them on the way (as
it were) to parl with them, and within a while returned back
and went down again; after this they came forth a second,
yea a third time, and retired accordingly until in the end
they brought up from beneath (as it were a ransom for the
dead body) a grub or little worm; which the others received
and took upon their shoulders, and after they had delivered
in exchange the aforesaid corpse, departed home.”<a id="Marker_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="marker">524</a></p>

<p>Of the ingenuity of the Ant in removing obstacles, the
following anecdote is a very appropriate illustration: A
gentleman of Cambridge one day observed an Ant dragging
along what, with respect to the creature’s size, might be denominated
a log of wood. Others were severally employed,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_155" title="155"></a><!--156.png-->
each in its own way. Presently the Ant in question came
to an ascent, where the weight of the wood seemed for a
while to overpower him: he did not remain long perplexed
with it; for three or four others, observing his dilemma,
came behind and pushed it up. As soon, however, as he
got it on level ground, they left it to his care, and went to
their own work. The piece he was drawing happened to
be considerably thicker at one end than the other. This
soon threw the poor fellow into a fresh difficulty; he unluckily
dragged it between two bits of wood. After several
fruitless efforts, finding it would not go through, he adopted
the only mode that even a man in similar circumstances
would have taken: he came behind it, pulled it back again,
and turned it on its edge; when, running again to the other
end, it passed through without the slightest difficulty.<a id="Marker_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="marker">525</a></p>

<p>Franklin was much inclined to believe Ants could communicate
their thoughts or desires to one another, and confirmed
his opinion by several experiments. Observing that
when an Ant finds some sugar, it runs immediately under
ground to its hole, where, having stayed a little while, a
whole army comes out, unites and marches to the place
where the sugar is, and carry it off by pieces; and that if
an Ant meets with a dead fly, which it cannot carry alone,
it immediately hastens home, and soon after some more come
out, creep to the fly, and carry it away; observing this, he
put a little earthen pot, containing some treacle, into a
closet, into which a number of Ants collected, and devoured
the treacle very quickly. He then shook them out, and
tied the pot with a thin string to a nail which he had fastened
in the ceiling, so that it hung down by the string. A
single Ant by chance remained in the pot, and when it had
gorged itself upon the treacle, and wanted to get off, it was
under great concern to find a way, and kept running about
the bottom of the pot, but in vain. At last it found, after
many attempts, the way to the ceiling, by going along the
string. After it was come there, it ran to the wall, and
thence to the ground. It had scarcely been away half an
hour, when a great swarm of Ants came out, got up to the
ceiling, and crept along the string into the pot, and began
to eat again. This they continued till the treacle was all
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_156" title="156"></a><!--157.png-->
eaten; in the mean time one swarm running down the string,
and the other up.<a id="Marker_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="marker">526</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested, that in such instances as the preceding,
the Ants may have been led by the scent or trace of
treacle likely to be left by the solitary prisoner; and the
following case, related by Bradley, is quoted to favor the
opinion: “A nest of Ants in a nobleman’s garden discovered
a closet, many yards within the house, in which
conserves were kept, which they constantly attended till the
nest was destroyed. Some, in their rambles, must have first
discovered this depot of sweets, and informed the rest of it.
It is remarkable that they always went to it by the same
track, scarcely varying an inch from it, though they had to
pass through two apartments; nor could the sweeping and
cleaning of the rooms discomfit them, or cause them to pursue
a different route.”<a id="Marker_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="marker">527</a></p>

<p>Dionisio Carli, of Piacenza, a missionary in Congo, lying
sick at that place, was awakened one night by his monkey
leaping on his head, and almost at the same time by his
Blacks crying out, much to his surprise, “Out! Out!
Father!” Thoroughly awake now, Carli asked them what
was the matter? “The Ants,” they cried, “are broke out,
and there is no time to be lost!” Not being able to stir,
he bid them carry him into the garden, which they did, four
of them lifting him upon his straw bed; and yet though
very quick about it, the Ants had already commenced crawling
up his legs. After shaking them off their master, the
Blacks took straw and fired it on the floor of four rooms,
where these insects by this time were over half a foot thick.
The pests being thus destroyed, Carli was conveyed back to
his chamber, where he found the stench so great from the
burnt bodies, that he was forced, he says, to hold his <i>monkey</i>
close to his nose!</p>

<p>These Ants, Carli relates, ate up every living object within
their reach; and of one cow, which was accidentally left over
night in the stable through which they passed, nothing but
the bones were found the next morning.<a id="Marker_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="marker">528</a> We need not
wonder at this, if we believe what Bosman has said of the
Black-ants of Guinea, which were so surprisingly rapacious
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_157" title="157"></a><!--158.png-->
that no animal could stand before them. He relates an instance
where they reduced for him one of his live sheep in
one night to a perfect skeleton, and that so nicely that it
surpassed the skill of the best anatomists.<a id="Marker_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="marker">529</a> Du Chaillu
says the elephant and gorilla fly before the attack of the
Bashikouay-ants, and the black men run for their lives.
Many a time has he himself, he says, been awakened out of
a sleep, and obliged to rush out of his hut and into the
water to save his life!<a id="Marker_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="marker">530</a> The Driver-ants<a id="Marker_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="marker">531</a> of Western Africa,
<i>A. nomma arcens</i>, have been known to kill the <i>Python natalensis</i>,
the largest serpent of that part of the world.<a id="Marker_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="marker">532</a></p>

<p>Col. St. Clair, after a visit by a species of small Red-ants,
makes mention of the following instance, among others, of
their singular destructiveness: “I next discovered that a
little pet deer, which I had purchased from a negro, was
extremely ill. I could not discover the cause of its malady,
until, placing it on its legs, I observed that it would not let
one foot touch the ground, and, on examining it, I found, to
my grief, that the Red-ants had absolutely eaten a hole into
the bone. The poor little animal pined all that day and
died in the evening.”<a id="Marker_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="marker">533</a></p>

<p>Capt. Stedman relates that the Fire-ants of Surinam
caused a whole company of soldiers to start and jump about
as if scalded with boiling water; and its nests were so
numerous that it was not easy to avoid them.<a id="Marker_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="marker">534</a> And Knox,
in his account of Ceylon, mentions a black Ant, called by
the natives <i>Coddia</i> or <i>Kaddiya</i>,<a id="Marker_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="marker">535</a> which, he says, “bites
desperately, as bad as if a man were burnt by a coal of fire;
but they are of a noble nature, and will not begin unless you
disturb them.” The reason the Singhalese assign for the
horrible pain occasioned by their bite is curious, and is thus
related by Knox: “Formerly these Ants went to ask a wife
of the <i>Noya</i>, a venomous and noble kind of snake;<a id="Marker_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="marker">536</a> and because
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_158" title="158"></a><!--159.png-->
they had such a high spirit to dare to offer to be related
to such a generous creature, they had this virtue bestowed
upon them, that they should sting after this manner.
And if they had obtained a wife of the Noya, they should have
had the privilege to sting full as bad as he.”<a id="Marker_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="marker">537</a> Capt. Stedman
has a story of a large Ant that stripped the trees of their
leaves, to feed, as was supposed by the natives of Surinam, a
blind serpent under ground,<a id="Marker_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="marker">538</a> which is somewhat akin to this:
as is also another, related to Kirby and Spence by a friend,
of a species of Mantis, taken in one of the Indian islands,
which, according to the received opinion among the natives,
was the parent of all their serpents.<a id="Marker_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="marker">539</a> But, the reverse:
Among the harmless snakes of Mexico is a beautiful one
about a foot in length, and of the thickness of the little
finger, which appears to take pleasure in the society of
Ants, insomuch that it will accompany these insects upon
their expeditions, and return with them to their usual nest.
From this peculiarity it is called by the Spaniards and
Mexicans the “Mother of the Ants.”<a id="Marker_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="marker">540</a></p>

<p>When in Africa, Du Chaillu was told by the natives that
criminals in former times were exposed to the path of the
Bashikouay-ants, as the most cruel way of putting them to
death.<a id="Marker_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="marker">541</a> This dreadful manner of torturing was at one time
also practiced by the Singhalese, and I have heard that several
British soldiers have thus met their fate. The Termites
have been referred to before as having been employed for a
similar purpose.</p>

<p>To check the ravages of the Coffee-bug, <i>Lecanium coffea</i>,
Walker, which for several years was devastating some of the
plantations of Ceylon, the experiment was made of introducing
the Red-ants, <i>Formica smaragdina</i>, Fab., which
feed greedily on the Coccus.<a id="Marker_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="marker">542</a> But the remedy threatened
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_159" title="159"></a><!--160.png-->
to be attended with some inconvenience, for, says Tennent,
the Malabar coolies, with bare and oiled skins, were so frequently
and fiercely assaulted by the Ants as to endanger
their stay on the estates.</p>

<p>The pupæ or cocoons of the Ants, during the day, are
placed near the surface of the Ant-hills to obtain heat, which
is indispensable to the growth of the inclosed insects. This
is taken advantage of in Europe to collect the cocoons in
large quantities as food for nightingales and larks. The
cocoons of a species of Wood-ant, <i>Formica rufa</i>, are the
only kind chosen. In most of the towns of Germany, one or
more individuals make a living during summer by this business
alone. “In 1832,” says a contributor to the Penny
Encyclopedia, “we visited an old woman at Dottendorf, near
Bern, who had collected for fourteen years. She went to
the woods in the morning, and collected in a bag the surfaces
of a number of Ant-hills where the cocoons were deposited,
taking Ants and all home to her cottage, near which
she had a small tiled shed covering a circular area, hollowed
out in the center, with a trench full of water around it. After
covering the hollow in the center with leafy boughs of walnut
or hazel, she strewed the contents of her bag on the level
part of the area within the trench, when the Nurse-ants immediately
seized the cocoons, and carried them into a hollow
under the boughs. The cocoons were thus brought into one
place, and after being from time to time removed, and black
ones separated by a boy who spread them out on a table,
and swept off what were bad with a strong feather, they
were ready for market, being sold for about 4<i>d.</i> or 6<i>d.</i> a
quart. Considerable quantities of these cocoons are dried
for winter food of birds, and are sold in the shops.”<a id="Marker_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="marker">543</a></p>

<p>Ants not only furnish food to man for his birds, but also
food for himself, in both the pupa and imago states. Nicoli
Conti, who traveled in India in the early part of the fifteenth
century, says the Siamese eat a species of Red-ant, of the
size of a small crab, which they consider a great delicacy
seasoned with pepper.<a id="Marker_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="marker">544</a> At the present day, the pupæ of a
species of Ants are a costly luxury with these people. They
are not much larger than grains of sand, and are sent to
table curried, or rolled in green leaves, mingled with shreds
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_160" title="160"></a><!--161.png-->
or very fine slices of fat pork.<a id="Marker_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="marker">545</a> And in the province of
Michuacan, Mexico, is a singular species of Ant, which
carries on its abdomen “a little bagful of a sweet substance,
of which the children are very fond: the Mexicans suppose
this to be a kind of honey collected by the insect; but
Clavigero thinks it rather its eggs.”<a id="Marker_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="marker">546</a></p>

<p>Piso, De Laet, Marcgrave, and other writers mention
their being an article of food in different parts of South
America. Piso speaks of yellow Ants called <i>Cupia</i> inhabiting
Brazil, the abdomen of which many used for food, as
well as a large species under the name of <i>Tama-joura:</i>
“Alia præterea datur grandis species <i>Tama-ioura</i> dicta

formicæ hic visuntur grandissimæ, quas indigenæ vulgo
comedunt; et in foris venales habent.”<a id="Marker_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="marker">548</a> And again: “Formicis

Lucas Fernandes Piedrahita, in his Historia General de
las Conquistas del Nuevo Regno de Granada, states that
cakes of Cazave and Ants were eaten in that country:
“Al tiempo de tostarlas para este efecto, dan el mismo olor
que los quesillos, que se labran para comer asados.”<a id="Marker_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="marker">550</a> Herrera
says, the natives of New Granada made their main food
of Ants, which they kept and reared in their yards.<a id="Marker_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="marker">551</a> Sloane
confirms this, and says they are publicly sold in the markets.<a id="Marker_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="marker">552</a>
Abbeville de Noromba tells us these great Ants are fricasseed.<a id="Marker_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="marker">553</a>
Schomburgk, in his journey to the sources of the Essequibo,
one evening saw all the boys of a village out shouting and
chasing with sticks and palm leaves a large species of winged
Ant, which they collected in great numbers in their calabashes
for food. When roasted or boiled, he says, the natives
considered these insects a great delicacy.<a id="Marker_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="marker">554</a> Humboldt
informs us that Ants are eaten by the Marivatanos and
Margueritares, mixed with resin for sauce.<a id="Marker_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="marker">555</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_161" title="161"></a><!--162.png-->

<p>Mr. Consett, in his Travels in Sweden, makes mention of
a young Swede who ate live Ants with the greatest relish imaginable.<a id="Marker_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="marker">556</a>
This author states also, that in some parts of
Sweden Ants are distilled along with rye, to give a flavor
to the inferior kinds of brandy.<a id="Marker_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="marker">557</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Tonga Group have a superstitious
belief that when their kings, and matabooles, or inferior
chiefs, die, they are wafted to Bulotu&mdash;“the island of the
blessed,” but the spirits of the lower class remain in the
world, and feed on Ants and lizards.<a id="Marker_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="marker">558</a></p>

<p>Ants also furnish us with an acid, called by the chemists
<i>Formic</i>, which is said to answer the same purposes as the
acetous acid. It is obtained in two modes: 1st. By distillation;
the insects are introduced into a glass retort, distilled
by a gentle heat, and the acid is found in the recipient. 2d.
By the process called lixiviation; the Ants are washed in
cold water, spread out upon a linen cloth, and boiling water
poured over them, which becomes charged with the acid
part.<a id="Marker_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="marker">559</a></p>

<p>Formic acid is shed so sensibly by the wood Ant, <i>Formica
rufa</i>, when an Ant-hill is stirred, that it can occasion an
inflammation. If a living frog, it is asserted, be fixed upon
an Ant-hill which is deranged, the animal will die in less
than five minutes, even without having been bitten by the
Ants.<a id="Marker_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="marker">560</a></p>

<p>We read in Purchas’s Pilgrims that the large Ant of the
West Indies is “so poysonfull that herewith the Indians
infect their arrowes so remedilesse, that not foure of an
hundred which are wounded escape.”<a id="Marker_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="marker">561</a></p>

<p>The medicinal virtues of the Ant are as follows: “Ants,
<i>Formica minor</i> of Schroder, heat and dry, and incite to
venery; their acid smell mightily refreshes the vital spirits.
They are said to cure the Flora, Lepra, and Lentigo. The
eggs (pupæ) are effectual against deafness, and correct the
hairiness of the cheeks of children being rubbed thereon.”</p>

<p>The Horse-ant, <i>Formica major</i>, Schrod., “provokes to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_162" title="162"></a><!--163.png-->
venery, and the oil thereof, by infusion, is good for the gout
and palsy.”<a id="Marker_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="marker">562</a></p>

<p>Sloane tells us the Spaniards in the West Indies have a
very highly valued medicated earth called “Makimaki,”
which he thinks is made of the nests of Ants.<a id="Marker_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="marker">563</a></p>

<p>There is a species of Ant in Cayenne, <i>Formica bispinosa</i>,
which collects from the bombax and silk-cotton trees a sort
of lint which the natives value much as a styptic in cases of
hemorrhage.<a id="Marker_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="marker">564</a></p>

<p>The magicians, as mentioned by Pliny, recommended that
the parings of all the finger-nails should be thrown at the
entrance of Ant-holes, and the first Ant to be taken which
should attempt to draw one into the hole; for if this, they
asserted, be attached to the neck of a patient, he will experience
a speedy cure.<a id="Marker_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="marker">565</a></p>

<p>The two following remarkable cures effected by Ants of
themselves are worthy of being noticed: Schuman, a missionary
among the negroes of Surinam, relates in one of
his letters, that after a most dangerous attack of the acclimating
fever, his body was covered with boils and painful
sores. He lay in his cot as helpless as a child, and had no
one to administer any relief or food but a poor old negro
woman, who sometimes was obliged to follow the rest to the
plantations in the woods. One morning while she was absent,
after spending a most restless and painful night, he observed
at sunrise an immense host of Ants entering through the roof,
and spread themselves over the inside of his chamber; and
expecting little else than that they would make a meal of
him, he commended his soul to God, and hoped thus to be
released from all suffering. They presently covered his bed,
and entering his sores caused him the most tormenting pain.
However, they soon quitted him, and continued their march,
and from that time he gradually recovered his health.<a id="Marker_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="marker">566</a></p>

<p>The second is a case of stiffness in the knee effectually
cured: In 1798, Mrs. Jane Crabley, aged 56 years, began
to complain of a most torturing pain, and considerable enlargement
of the knee-pan, which she described as, and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_163" title="163"></a><!--164.png-->
which her neighbors believed to be, a smart paroxysm of
gout. Early in February, 1799, the inflammation and pain
entirely ceased, but the swelling continued, and rather increased.
The joint of the knee, from disuse, became perfectly
stiff, and, owing to the particular form and size of
her breasts, no relief could be gained by the use of crutches.
However, toward the end of May, the Ants became so
strangely troublesome to her, that she was sometimes obliged
to avail herself of the help of travelers to assist her in
changing her station. Still, however, they followed her, and
seemed entirely attracted by her now useless knee. She
was at first considerably annoyed by these little torments,
but, in a few days, became not only reconciled to their
intrusion, but was desirous of having her chair placed
where she imagined them most to abound, even giving them
freer access to her knee by turning down her stocking; for,
she said, “the cold numbness she suffered just around the
patella was eased and relieved by their bite; and that it was
even pleasurable;” and, strange to say, these insects bit her
nowhere else. The skin at first was pale and sallow, but
began now to assume a lively red color; a clear and subtile
liquid oozed from every puncture the Ants had left; the
swelling and stiffness of the joint gradually abated; and,
on the 25th of July, she walked home with the help of a
stick, and before winter perfectly recovered the use of her
limb.<a id="Marker_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="marker">567</a></p>

<p>Says Plutarch, as translated by Holland: “The bear finding
herself upon fulness given to loth and distaste for food,
she goes to find out Ants’ nests, where she sits her down,
lilling out her tongue, which is glib and soft with a kind of
sweet and slimy humour, until it be full of Ants and their
egges, then draweth it she in again, swalloweth them down,
and thereby cureth her lothing stomack.”<a id="Marker_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="marker">568</a></p>

<p>Also, in the Treasurie of Avncient and Moderne Times,
we find: “The Bear, being poysoned by the Hearbe named
<i>Mandragoras</i>, or <i>Mandrake</i>, doth purge his bodie by the
eating of Ants or Pismires.”<a id="Marker_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="marker">569</a></p>

<p>M. Huber, initiated in the mysteries of the life of these
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_164" title="164"></a><!--165.png-->
insects, and whose observations can be most relied on, has
made us acquainted with two of their maladies: one is a
species of vertigo, occasioned, as he thinks, by a too great
heat of the sun, and which transforms them for two or three
minutes into a sort of bacchantes; the other malady, much
more severe, causes them to lose the faculty of directing
themselves in a right line. These Ants turn in a very narrow
circle, and always in the same direction. A virgin
female, inclosed in a sand-box, and attacked by this mania,
made a thousand turns by the hour, describing a circle of
about an inch in diameter; it continued this operation for
seven days, and even during the night.<a id="Marker_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="marker">570</a></p>

<p>Immense swarms of winged Ants are occasionally met
with, and some have been recorded of such prodigious density
and magnitude as to darken the air like a thick cloud,
and to cover the ground or water for a considerable extent
where they settled. We find in the memoirs of the Berlin
Academy a description of a remarkable swarm, observed by
M. Gleditch, which from afar produced an effect somewhat
similar to that of an Aurora Borealis, when, from the edge
of the cloud, shoot forth by jets many columns of flame and
vapor, many rays like lightning, but without its brilliancy.
Columns of Ants were coming and going here and there,
but always rising upward, with inconceivable rapidity. They
appeared to raise themselves above the clouds, to thicken
there, and become more and more obscure. Other columns
followed the preceding, raised themselves in like manner,
shooting forth many times with equal swiftness, or mounting
one after the other. Each column resembled a very slender
net-work, and exhibited a tremulous, undulating, and serpentine
motion. It was composed of an innumerable multitude
of little winged insects, altogether black, which were
continually ascending and descending in an irregular manner.<a id="Marker_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="marker">571</a>
A similar kind of Ants is spoken of by Mr. Accolutte,
a clergyman of Breslau, which resembled columns of
smoke, and which fell on the churches and tops of the
houses, where they could be gathered by handfuls. In the
German <i>Ephemerides</i>, Dr. Chas. Rayger gives an account
of a large swarm which crossed over the town of Posen, and
was directing its course toward the Danube. The whole
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_165" title="165"></a><!--166.png-->
town was strewed with Ants, so that it was impossible to
walk without crushing thirty or forty at every step. And
more recently, Mr. Dorthes, in the <i>Journal de Physique</i> for
1790, relates the appearance of a similar phenomenon at
Montpellier. The shoals moved about in different directions,
having a singular intestine motion in each column,
and also a general motion of rotation. About sunset all
fell to the ground, and, on examining them, they were found
to belong to the <i>Formica nigra</i> of Linnæus.<a id="Marker_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="marker">572</a></p>

<p>“In September, 1814,” says Dr. Bromley, surgeon of
the Clorinde, in a letter to Mr. MacLeay, “being on the deck
of the hulk to the Clorinde (then in the river Medway), my
attention was drawn to the water by the first lieutenant observing
there was something black floating down the tide.
On looking with a glass, I discovered they were insects.
The boat was sent, and brought a bucketful of them on
board; they proved to be a large species of Ant, and extended
from the upper part of Salt-pan Reach out toward
the Great Nore, a distance of five or six miles. The column
appeared to be in breadth eight or ten feet, and in height
about six inches, which I suppose must have been from their
resting one upon another.”<a id="Marker_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="marker">573</a> Purchas seems to have witnessed
a similar phenomenon on shore. “Other sorts of
Ants,” says he, “there are many, of which some become
winged, and fill the air with swarms, which sometimes happens
in England. On Bartholomew, 1613, I was in the
island of Foulness, on our Essex shore, where were such
clouds of these flying pismires, that we could nowhere flee
from them, but they filled our clothes; yea, the floors of
some houses where they fell were in a manner covered with
a black carpet of creeping Ants, which they say drown
themselves about that time of the year in the sea.”<a id="Marker_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="marker">574</a></p>

<p>When Colonel Sir Augustus Frazer, of the British horse-artillery,
was surveying, on the 6th of October, 1813, the
scene of the battle of the Pyrenees from the summit of the
mountain called Pena de Aya, or Les Quartres Couronnes,
he and his friends were enveloped by a swarm of Ants, so numerous
as entirely to intercept their view, so that they were
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_166" title="166"></a><!--167.png-->
obliged to remove to another station in order to get rid of
them.<a id="Marker_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="marker">575</a></p>

<p>“Not long since,” says Josselyn in his Voyage to New
England, London, 1674, “winged Ants were poured down
upon the Lands out of the clouds in a storm betwixt <i>Blackpoint</i>
and <i>Saco</i>, where the passenger might have walkt up
to the Ancles in them.”<a id="Marker_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="marker">576</a></p>

<p>Wingless Ants, in swarms or armies, also migrate at particular
seasons; but for what purpose is not clear, except
to obtain better forage. In Guiana, Mr. Waterton says he
has met with a colony of a species of small Ant marching
in order, each having in its mouth a leaf; and the army extended
three miles in length, and was six feet broad.<a id="Marker_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="marker">577</a></p>

<p>It is recorded by Oviedo and Herrera, that the whole
island of Hispaniola was almost abandoned in consequence
of the Sugar-Ant, <i>Formica omnivora</i> of Linnæus, which,
in 1518 and the two succeeding years, overran in such countless
myriads that island, devouring all vegetation, and causing
a famine which nearly depopulated the Spanish colony.
A tradition, says Schomburgk, prevails in Jamaica that the
town of Sevilla Nueva, which was founded by Esquivel in
the beginning of the sixteenth century, was entirely deserted
for a similar reason. Herrera relates that, in order
to get rid of this fearful scourge in Hispaniola, the priests
caused great processions and vows to be made in honor of
their patron saint, St. Saturnin, and that the day of this
saint was celebrated with great solemnities, and the Ants in
consequence began to disappear. How this saint was chosen,
we read in Purchas’s Pilgrims: “This miserie (caused by the
Ants) so perplexed the <i>Spaniards</i>, that they sought as strange
a remedie as was the disease, which was to chuse some Saint
for their Patron against the Antes. <i>Alexander Giraldine</i>,
the Bishop, having sung a solemne and Pontifical Masse,
after the consecration and Eleuation of the Sacrament, and
devout prayers made by him and the people, opened a
Booke in which was a Catalogue of the Saints, by lot to
chuse some he or she Saint, whom God should please to
appoint their Advocate against the Calamitie. And the
Lot fell vpon Saint <i>Saturnine</i>, whose Feast is on the nine
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_167" title="167"></a><!--168.png-->
and twentieth of Nouember; after which the Ant damage
became more tolerable, and by little and little diminished,
by God’s mercie and intercession of that Saint.”<a id="Marker_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="marker">578</a></p>

<p>These devouring Ants showed themselves about the year
1760 in Barbados, and caused such devastations that, in
the words of Dr. Coke, “it was deliberated whether that
island, formerly so flourishing, should not be deserted.” In
1763, Martinique was visited by these devastating hordes;
and about the year 1770 they made their appearance in the
island of Granada. Barbados, Granada, and Martinique
suffered more than any other islands from this plague.
Granada especially was reduced to a state of the most deplorable
desolation; for, it is said, their numbers there
were so immense that they covered the roads for many
miles together; and so crowded were they in many places
that the impressions made by the feet of horses, which traveled
over them, would remain visible but for a moment or
two, for they were almost instantly filled up by the surrounding
swarms. Mr. Schomburgk assures us that calves,
pigs, and chickens, when in a helpless state, were attacked
by such large numbers of these Ants that they perished, and
were soon reduced to skeletons when not timely assisted.
It is asserted by Dr. Coke that the greatest precaution was
requisite to prevent their attacks on men who were afflicted
with sores, on women who were confined, and on children
that were unable to assist themselves. Mr. Castle, from his
own observation, states that even burning coals laid in their
way, were extinguished by the amazing numbers which
rushed upon them.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the myriads that were destroyed by fire,
water, poison, and other means, the devastations continued
to such an alarming extent, that in 1776 the government of
Martinique offered a reward of a million of their currency
for a remedy against this plague; and the legislature of
Granada offered £20,000 for the same object; but all attempts
proved ineffectual until the hurricane in 1780 effected
what human power had been unable to accomplish.</p>

<p>In 1814, the Ants again made their appearance in the
island of Barbados, doing considerable injury; but happily
they did not continue long.<a id="Marker_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="marker">579</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_168" title="168"></a><!--169.png-->

<p>Malouet, in visiting the forests of Guiana, of which he
has spoken in his travels into that part of the globe, perceived
in the midst of a level savanna, as far as the eye
could reach, a hillock which he would have attributed to
the hand of man, if M. de Prefontaine, who accompanied
him, had not informed him that, in spite of its gigantic construction,
it was the work of black Ants of the largest species
(most probably of the genus <i>Ponera</i>). He proposed
to conduct him, not to the Ant-hill, where both of them
would infallibly have been devoured, but to the road of the
workers. M. Malouet did not approach within more than
forty paces of the habitation of these insects. It had the
form of a pyramid truncated at one-third of its height, and
he estimated that its elevation might be about fifteen or
twenty feet, on a basis of from thirty to forty. M. de Prefontaine
told him that the cultivators were obliged to abandon
a new establishment, when they had the misfortune to meet
with one of these fortresses, unless they had sufficient
strength to form a regular siege. This even occurred to
M. de Prefontaine himself on his first encampment at
Kourva. He was desirous of forming a second a little farther
on, and perceived upon the soil a mound of earth similar
to that which we have just described. He caused a circular
trench to be hollowed, which he filled with a great
quantity of dry wood, and, after having set fire to it in
every point of its circumference, he attacked the Ant-hill
with a train of artillery. Thus every issue was closed to
the hostile army, which, to escape from the invasion of the
flames and the shaking and plowing of the ground by the
cannon-balls, was obliged to traverse, in its retreat, a trench
filled with fire, where it was entirely cut off.<a id="Marker_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="marker">580</a></p>

<p>The Portuguese found such prodigious numbers of Ants
upon their first landing at Brazil, that they called them Rey
de Brazil, King of Brazil, a name which they now there
bear.<a id="Marker_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="marker">581</a></p>

<p>Mr. Southey states, on the authority of Manoel Felix, that
the Red-ants devoured the cloths of the altar in the Convent
of S. Antonio, or S. Luiz (Maranham, Brazil), and also
brought up into the church pieces of shrouds from the
graves; whereupon the friars prosecuted them according to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_169" title="169"></a><!--170.png-->
due form of ecclesiastical law. What the sentence was in
this case, we are unable to learn. A similar case, however,
the historian informs us, had occurred in the Franciscan
Convent at Avignon, where the Ants did so much mischief
that a suit was instituted against them, and they were excommunicated,
and ordered by the friars, in pursuance of
their sentence, to remove within three days to a place assigned
them in the center of the earth. The Canonical
account gravely adds, that the Ants obeyed, and carried
away all their young, and all their stores.<a id="Marker_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="marker">582</a></p>

<p>Annius writes, that an ancient city situate near the Volscian
Lake, and called Contenebra, was in times past overthrown
by Ants, and that the place was thereupon commonly
called to his day, “the camp of the Ants.”<a id="Marker_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="marker">583</a></p>

<p>Ctesias makes mention “of a horse-pismire (<i>i.e.</i> the bigger
kind of them in hollow trees) which was fed by the Magi,
till hee grew to such a vast bulke as to devour two pound
of flesh a daye.”<a id="Marker_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="marker">584</a></p>

<p>Martial has written the following beautiful epigram on
an Ant inclosed in amber: “While an Ant was wandering
under the shade of the tree of Phaeton, a drop of amber
enveloped the tiny insect; thus she, who in life was disregarded,
became precious by death.</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line quote">“A drop of amber from the weeping plant,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>It has been said, remarks Mr. Southey, and regarded as a
vulgar error, that Ants cannot pass over a line of chalk: the
fact, however, is certain. Mr. Coleridge tried the experiment
at Malta, he continues, and immediately discovered
the cause: The formic acid is so powerful, that it acts upon
the chalk, and the legs of the insect are burnt by the instantaneous
effervescence!<a id="Marker_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="marker">586</a></p>

<p>Paxamus says, that if you take some Ants and burn them,
you will drive away the others, as experience has taught us.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_170" title="170"></a><!--171.png-->
Ants also, he continues, will not touch a vessel with honey,
although the vessel may happen to be without its cover, if
you wrap it in white wool, or if you scatter white earth or
ruddle round it. If a person, continues Paxamus, takes a
grain of wheat carried by an Ant with the thumb of his left
hand, and lays it in a skin of Phœnician dye, and ties it
round the head of his wife, it will prove to be the cause of
abortion in a state of gestation.<a id="Marker_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="marker">587</a></p>

<p>Pliny says the proper remedy for the venom of the <i>Solipuga</i>
or <i>Solpuga</i> Ant, and for that of all kinds of Ants, is a
bat’s heart.<a id="Marker_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="marker">588</a></p>

<p>Callicrates used to make Ants, and other such little creatures,
out of ivory, with so much skill and ingenuity that
other men could not discern the counterfeits from the originals
even with the help of glasses.<a id="Marker_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="marker">589</a></p>


<h3 id="Vespidae_Wasps_Hornets">Vespidæ&mdash;Wasps, Hornets.</h3>

<p>Concerning the generation of the Wasp, Topsel and Moufet
have the following: “Isidore affirms that Wasps come out
of the putrefied carkasses of asses, although he may be mistaken,
for all agree that the Scarabees are procreated from
them: rather am I of opinion with Pliny, 1. ii. c. 20, and
the Greek authors, that they are sprung from the dead
bodies of horses, for the horse is a valiant and warlike
creature, hence is that verse frequently and commonly used
among the Greeks:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Wasps come from horses, Bees from bulls are bred.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And indeed their more than ordinary swiftnesse and their
eagernesse in fight, are sufficient arguments that they can
take their original from no other creature (much less from
an asse, hart, or oxe) since that Nature never granted to
any creatures else, to excel both in swiftness and valour.
And surely that I may give another sense of that proverb
of Aristotle,</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_171" title="171"></a><!--172.png-->


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Hail the daughters of the wing-footed steed:</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>this would I suppose fit to be spoken in way of jest and
scorn to scolding women, which do imitate the hastiness and
froward disposition of the Wasp. Other sorts of them are
produced out of the putrid corps of the Crocodiles, if Horus
and the Ægyptians be to be believed, for which reason when
they mean a Wasp, they set it forth by an horse or crocodile.
Nicander gives them the name <i>lukosnoadon</i>, because
they sometimes come from the dead carkasses of wolves.
Bellenacensis and Vicentius say, that Wasps come out of
the putrefaction of an old deer’s head, flying sometimes out
of the eyes, sometimes out of the nostrils.… There are
those also that affirm that Wasps are begotten of the earth
and rottenness of some kind of fruits, as Albertus and the
Arabick scholiast.”</p>

<p>Of the Hornet, likewise, these writers tell the following
fabulous stories: “The Latins call the Hornets <i>Crabrones</i>,
perchance from the village Crabra in the countrey of Tusculum
(where there are great store of them), or from the
word <i>Caballus</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a horse, who is said to be their father.
According to that of Ovid, <i>Met.</i> 15:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The warlike horse if buried under ground,</div>
<div class="line">Shortly a brood of Hornets will be found.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Albertus calls it a yellow Bee. Cardanus will needs have
them to arise from the dead mule. Plutarch, in the life of
Cleomedes, saith they come out of horse flesh, as the Bees
do out of the oxe his paunch. Virgil saith they are produced
of the asse.… I conceive that those are produced
of the harder flesh of the horse, and the Wasps of the more
tender flesh.”<a id="Marker_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="marker">590</a></p>

<p>The Hornet (but whether or not it was the common
species, <i>Vespa crabro</i>, Linn., is uncertain), we learn from
Scriptures was employed by Providence to drive out the
impious inhabitants of Canaan, and subdue them under the
hand of the Israelites.&mdash;“And I sent the Hornet before you,
which drave them out before you, even the two kings of the
Amorites.”<a id="Marker_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="marker">591</a></p>

<p>In the second volume of Lieutenant Holman’s Travels,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_172" title="172"></a><!--173.png-->
the following anecdote is related: “Eight miles from Grandie&mdash;&mdash;,
the muleteers suddenly called out ‘Marambundas!
Marambundas!’ which indicated the approach of Wasps.
In a moment all the animals, whether loaded or otherwise,
lay down on their backs, kicking most violently; while the
blacks, and all persons not already attacked, ran away in
different directions, all being careful, by a wide sweep, to
avoid the swarms of tormentors that came forward like a
cloud. I never witnessed a panic so sudden and complete,
and really believe that the bursting of a water-spout could
hardly have produced more commotion. However, it must
be confessed that the alarm was not without good reason,
for so severe is the torture inflicted by these pigmy assailants,
that the bravest travelers are not ashamed to fly, the
instant they perceive the host approaching, which is of common
occurrence on the Campos.”<a id="Marker_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="marker">592</a></p>

<p>Dr. Fairfax, in the Philosophical Transactions, mentions
a lady, who had such a horror of Wasps, that during the
season in which they abound in houses, she always confined
herself to her apartment.<a id="Marker_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="marker">593</a></p>

<p>Dr. James tells us: “The combs (of the Hornet) are
recommended in a drench for that disorder in horses, which
Vigetius, L. 2, c. 23, calls scrofula, meaning, I believe, what
we call the strangles.”<a id="Marker_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="marker">594</a></p>

<p>Hornets’-nest is smoked under horses’ noses for distemper,
cold in the head, and such like diseases. It is also given to
horses in their feed for thick-windedness.</p>

<p>The nests of Hornets are gathered by the country people
to clean spectacles.</p>

<p>Topsel, in his History of Four-footed Beasts and Serpents,
has the following prognostications of the weather from the
appearances of Hornets: “They serve instead of good
almanacks to countrey people, to foretel tempests and
change of weather, as hail, rain, and snow: for if they flie
about in greater numbers, and be oftner seen about any
place, then usually they are wont, it is a signe of heat and
fair weather the next day. But if about twilight they are
observed to enter often their nests, as though they would
hide themselves, you must the next day expect rain, winde,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_173" title="173"></a><!--174.png-->
or some stormy, troublesome or boysterous season: whereupon
Avienus hath these verses:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">So if the buzzing troups of Hornets hoarse to flie,</div>
<div class="line">In spacious air ’bout Autumn’s end you see,</div>
<div class="line">When Virgil star the evening lamp espie,</div>
<div class="line">Then from the sea some stormy tempest sure shall be.”<a id="Marker_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="marker">595</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“In the year 190, before the birth of Christ,” say Moufet
and Topsel, “as Julius witnesseth, an infinite multitude of
Wasps flew into the market at Capua, and sate in the temple
of Mars, they were with great diligence taken and burnt
solemnly, yet they did foreshew the coming of the enemy
and the burning of the city.”<a id="Marker_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="marker">596</a></p>

<p>The first Wasp seen in the season should always be killed.
By so doing, you secure to yourself good luck and freedom
from enemies throughout the year.<a id="Marker_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="marker">597</a> This is an English
superstition, and it prevails in parts of America. We have
one, also, directly opposed to it, namely, that the first Wasp
seen in the season should not be killed if you wish to secure
to yourself good luck. Many of our people, too, will kill a
Wasp at no time, for, if killed, they say, it will bring upon
them bad luck.</p>

<p>If a Wasp stings you, our superstitious think that your
foes will get the advantage of you.</p>

<p>If the first Wasp seen in the season be seen in your house,
it is a sign that you will form an unpleasant acquaintance.
If the first Bee seen in the season be seen in your house, it
is a sign you will form a pleasant and useful acquaintance.
This arose doubtless from the apparent uselessness of the
former, and worth of the latter insect.</p>

<p>Wasps building in a house foretell the coming to want of
the family occupying it. Likewise arose from the unthriftiness
of this insect.</p>

<p>If Hornets build high, the winter will be dry and mild;
if low, cold and stormy. This is firmly believed in Virginia;
and the idea seems to be, that if the nest is built high it will
be more exposed to the wind than if built low.</p>

<p>That a person may not be stung by Wasps, Paxamus says:
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_174" title="174"></a><!--175.png-->
“Let the person be rubbed with the juice of wild-mallow,
and he will not be stung.”<a id="Marker_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="marker">598</a></p>

<p>The Creoles of Mauritius eat the larvæ of Wasps, which
they roast in the combs. In taking the nests, they drive off
the Wasps by means of a burning rag fastened to the end of
a stick. The combs are sold at the bazaar of Port Louis.<a id="Marker_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="marker">599</a></p>

<p>The following story, of the cunning of the fox in killing
the Wasps to obtain their combs, is told by Ælian: “The
fox (a subtile creature) is said to prey upon the Wasp in
this manner: he puts his tail into the Wasps’ nest so long
till it be all covered with Wasps, which he espying, pulls it
out and beats them against the next stone or tree he meets
withall till they be all dead, this being done again and again
till all the Wasps be destroyed, he sets upon their combs
and devours them.”<a id="Marker_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="marker">600</a></p>

<p>The Chinese Herbal contains a singular notion, prevalent
also in India, concerning the generation of the Sphex, or
solitary Wasp. When the female lays her eggs in the
clayey nidus she makes in houses, she incloses the dead
body of a caterpillar in it for the subsistence of the worms
when they are hatched. Those who observed her entombing
the caterpillar did not look for the eggs, and immediately
concluded that the Sphex took the worm for the progeny,
and say, that as she plastered up the hole of the nest, she
hummed a constant song over it, saying, “<i>Class with me!
class with me!</i>”&mdash;and the transformation gradually took
place, and was perfected in its silent grave by the next
spring, when a winged Wasp emerged, to continue its posterity
the coming autumn in the same mysterious way.<a id="Marker_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="marker">601</a></p>


<h3 id="Apidae_Bees">Apidæ&mdash;Bees.</h3>

<p>Concerning the piety of Bees, we find the following
legends:</p>

<p>“A certaine simple woman having some stals of Bees which
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_175" title="175"></a><!--176.png-->
yeelded not vnto her hir desired profit, but did consume and
die of the murraine; made her mone to another woman more
simple than hir selfe: who gave her councel to get a consecrated
host or round Godamighty and put it among them.
According to whose advice she went to the priest to receive
the host; which when she had done, she kept it in hir month,
and being come home againe she tooke it out and put it into
one of hir hives. Wherevpon the murraine ceased, and the
honey abounded. The woman therefore lifting vp the hive
at the due time to take out the honie, sawe there (most
strange to be seene) a chapel built by the Bees with an altar
in it, the wals adorned by marvelous skil of architecture with
windowes conveniently set in their places: also a dore and a
steeple with bels. And the host being laid vpon the altar,
the Bees making a sweet noise flew round about it.”<a id="Marker_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="marker">602</a></p>

<p>Mr. Hawker’s legend is to this effect: A Cornish woman,
one summer, finding her Bees refused to leave their “cloistered
home” and had “ceased to play around the cottage flowers,”
concealed a portion of the Holy Eucharist which she obtained
at church:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">She bore it to her distant home,</div>
<div class="line i2">  She laid it by the hive</div>
<div class="line">To lure the wanderers forth to roam,</div>
<div class="line i2">  That so her store might thrive;&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">’Twas a wild wish, a thought unblest,</div>
<div class="line">Some evil legend of the west.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">But lo! at morning-tide a sign</div>
<div class="line i2">  For wondering eyes to trace,</div>
<div class="line">They found above that Bread, a shrine</div>
<div class="line i2">  Rear’d by the harmless race!</div>
<div class="line">They brought their walls from bud and flower,</div>
<div class="line">They built bright roof and beamy tower!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Was it a dream? or did they hear</div>
<div class="line i2">  Float from those golden cells</div>
<div class="line">A sound, as of a psaltery near,</div>
<div class="line i2">  Or soft and silvery bells?</div>
<div class="line">A low sweet psalm, that grieved within</div>
<div class="line">In mournful memory of the sin!<a id="Marker_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="marker">603</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following passage, from Howell’s <i>Parley of Beasts</i>,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_176" title="176"></a><!--177.png-->
furnishes a similar legend of the piety of Bees. Bee
speaks:</p>

<p>“Know, sir, that we have also a religion as well as you, and
so exact a government among us here; our hummings you
speak of are as so many hymns to the Great God of Nature;
and there is a miraculous example in <i>Cæsarius Cisterniensis</i>,
of some of the Holy Eucharist being let fall in a meadow by
a priest, as he was returning from visiting a sick body; a
swarm of Bees hard-by took It up, and in a solemn kind of
procession carried It to their hive, and their erected an
altar of the purest wax for it, where it was found in that
form, and untouched.”<a id="Marker_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="marker">604</a></p>

<p>Butler, quoting Thomas Bozius, tells us the following:</p>

<p>“Certaine theeves (thieves) having stolen the silver boxe
wherein the wafer-Gods vse to lie, and finding one of them
there being loath, belike, that he should lie abroad all night,
did not cast him away, but laid him under a hive: whom the
Bees acknowledging advanced to a high roome in the hive,
and there insteade of his silver boxe made him another of
the whitest wax: and when they had so done, in worshippe
of him, and set howres they sang most sweetly beyond all
measure about it: yea the owner of them took them at it at
midnight with a light and al. Wherewith the bishop being
made acquainted, came thither with many others: and lifting
vp the hive he sawe there neere the top a most fine boxe,
wherein the host was laid, and the quires of Bees singing
about it, and keeping watch in the night, as monkes do in
their cloisters. The bishop therefore taking the host, carried
it with the greater honour into the church: whether
many resorting were cured of innumerable diseases.”<a id="Marker_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="marker">605</a></p>

<p>Another legend, from the School of the Eucharist, is as
follows:</p>

<p>“A peasant swayed by a covetous mind, being communicated
on Easter-Day, received the Host in his mouth, and
afterwards laid it among his bees, believing that all the Bees
of the neighborhood would come thither to work their wax
and honey. This covetous, impious wretch was not wholly
disappointed of his hopes; for all his neighbors’ Bees came
indeed to his hives, but not to make honey, but to render
there the honours due to the Creator. The issue of their
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_177" title="177"></a><!--178.png-->
arrival was that they melodiously sang to Him songs of
praise as they were able; after that they built a little church
with their wax from the foundations to the roof, divided into
three rooms, sustained by pillars, with their bases and chapiters.
They had there also an Altar, upon which they had
laid the precious Body of our Lord, and flew round about
it, continuing their musick. The peasant … coming nigh
that hive where he had put the H. Sacrament, the Bees issued
out furiously by troops, and surrounding him on all
sides, revenged the irreverence done to their Creator, and
stung him so severely that they left him in a sad case. This
punishment made this miserable wretch come to himself, who,
acknowledging his error, went to find out the parish priest to
confess his fault to him.…” etc.<a id="Marker_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="marker">606</a></p>

<p>We quote also another from the School of the Eucharist:</p>

<p>“A certain peasant of Auvergne, a province in France,
perceiving that his Bees were likely to die, to prevent this
misfortune, was advised, after he had received the communion,
to reserve the Host, and to blow it into one of the
hives. As he tried to do it, the Host fell on the ground.
Behold now a wonder! On a sudden all the Bees came
forth out of their hives, and ranging themselves in good order,
lifted the Host from the ground, and carrying it in
upon their wings, placed it among the combes. After this
the man went out about his business, and at his return found
that this advice had succeeded ill, for all his Bees were
dead.…”<a id="Marker_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="marker">607</a></p>

<p>We will close this series of legends with one from the
Lives of the Saints:</p>

<p>“When a thief by night had stolen St. Medard’s Bees,
they, in their master’s quarrel, leaving their hive, set upon
the malefactor, and eagerly pursuing him which way soever
he ran, would not cease stinging of him until they had made
him (whether he would or no) to go back again to their
master’s house; and there, falling prostrate at his feet, submissly
to cry him mercy for the crime committed. Which
being done, so soon as the Saint extended unto him the
hand of benediction, the Bees, like obedient servants, did
forthwith stay from persecuting him, and evidently yielded
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_178" title="178"></a><!--179.png-->
themselves to the ancient possession and custody of their
master.”<a id="Marker_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="marker">608</a></p>

<p>By the Greeks, Bees were accounted an omen of future
eloquence;<a id="Marker_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="marker">609</a> the soothsayers of the Romans, however, deemed
them always of evil augury.<a id="Marker_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="marker">610</a> They afforded also to the
Romans presages of public interest, “clustering, as they
do, like a bunch of grapes, upon houses or temples; presages,
in fact, that are often accounted for by great events.”<a id="Marker_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="marker">611</a>
The instances of happy omens afforded by swarms of Bees
are the following:</p>

<p>“It is said of Pindar,” we read in Pausanias’ History of
Greece, “that when he was a young man, as he was going
to Thespia, being wearied with the heat, as it was noon, and
in the height of summer, he fell asleep at a small distance
from the public road; and that Bees, as he was asleep, flew
to him and wrought their honey on his lips. This circumstance
first induced Pindar to compose verses.”<a id="Marker_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="marker">612</a></p>

<p>A similar incident is mentioned in the life of Plato:</p>

<p>“Whilst <i>Plato</i> was yet an infant carried in the arms of
his mother <i>Perictione, Aristo</i> his father went to <i>Hymettus</i>
(a mountain in <i>Attica</i> eminent for abundance of Bees and
Honey) to sacrifice to the Muses or Nymphs, taking his
Wife and Child along with him; as they were busied in the
Divine Rites, she laid the Child in a Thicket of Myrtles hard
by; to whom, as he slept (<i>in cunis dormienti</i>) came a
Swarm of Bees, Artists of Hymettian Honey, flying and
buzzing about him, and (as it is reported) made a Honeycomb
in his mouth. This was taken for a presage of the
singular sweetness of his discourse; his future Eloquence
foreseen in his infancy.”<a id="Marker_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="marker">613</a></p>

<p>From Butler’s Lives of the Saints we have the following:</p>

<p>“The birth of St. Ambrose happened about the year 340
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and whilst the child lay asleep in one of the courts of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_179" title="179"></a><!--180.png-->
his father’s palace, a swarm of Bees flew about his cradle,
and some of them even crept in and out at his mouth, which
was open; and at last mounted up into the air so high, that
they quite vanished out of sight. This,” concludes the
Reverend Alban, “was esteemed a presage of future greatness
and eloquence.”<a id="Marker_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="marker">614</a></p>

<p>Another instance is mentioned in the Feminine Monarchie,
printed at Oxford in 1634, p. 22.</p>

<p>“When <i>Ludovicus Vives</i> was sent by Cardinal Wolsey
to Oxford, there to be a public professor of Rhetoric, being
placed in the College of Bees, he was welcomed thither by a
swarm of Bees; which sweet creatures, to signifie the incomparable
sweetnesse of his eloquence, settled themselves over
his head, under the leads of his study, where they have continued
to this day.… How sweetly did all things then
accord, when in this neat μουσαῖον newly consecrated to the
Muses, the Muses’ sweetest favorite was thus honoured by
the Muses’ birds.”<a id="Marker_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="marker">615</a></p>

<p>Moufet, in his Theater of Insects, and Topsel, in almost
the same words in his History of Four-footed Beasts and
Serpents, gives the following list of remarkable omens
drawn from Bees:</p>

<p>“Whereas the most high God did create all other creatures
for our use; so especially the Bees, not only that as
mistresses they might hold forth to us a patern of politick
and œconomic vertues, and inform our understanding; but
that they might be able as extraordinary foretellers, to foreshew
the success and event of things to come; for in the
years 90, 98, 113, 208, before the birth of Christ, when as
mighty huge swarms of Bees did settle in the chief market-place,
and in the beast-market upon private citizens’ houses,
and on the temple of Mars, there were at that time stratagems
of enemies against Rome, wherewith the whole state
was like to be surprised and destroyed. In the reign of
Severus, the Bees made combes in his military ensigns, and
especially in the camp of Niger. Divers wars upon this
ensued between both the parties of Severus and Niger, and
battels of doubtful event, while at length the Severian faction
prevailed. The statues also of Antonius Pius placed
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_180" title="180"></a><!--181.png-->
here and there all over Hetruria, were all covered with
swarms of Bees; and after that settled in the camp of
Cassius; what great commotions after followed Julius
Capitolinus relates in his history. At what time also,
through the treachery of the Germans in Germany, there
was a mighty slaughter and overthrow of the Romans. P.
Fabius, and Q. Elius being consuls in the camp of Drusus
in the tent of Hostilius Rutilus, a swarm of Bees is reported
to have sate so thick, that they covered the rope and
the spear that held up the tent. M. Lepidus, and Munat.
Plancus being consuls, as also in the consulship of L. Paulus,
and C. Metellus, swarms of Bees flying to Rome (as the
augurs very well conjectured) did foretell the near approach
of the enemy. Pompey likewise making war against Cæsar,
when he had called his allies together, he set his army in
order as he went out of Dyrrachium, Bees met him and sate
so thick upon his ensigns that they could not be seen what
they were. Philistus and Ælian relate, that while Dionysius
the tyrant did in vain spur his horse that stuck in the
mire, and there at length left him, the horse quitting himself
by his own strength, did follow after his master the same
way he went with a swarm of Bees sticking on his mane;
intimating by that prodigy that tyrannical government which
Dionysius affected over the Galeotæ. In the Helvetian
History we read, that in the year 1385, when Leopoldus of
Austria began to march towards Sempachum with his army,
a swarm of Bees flew to the town and there sate upon the
tyles; whereby the common people rightly foretold that
some forain force was marching towards them. So Virgil,
in 7 Æneid:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The Bees flew buzzing through the liquid air:</div>
<div class="line i2">  And pitcht upon the top o’ th’ laurel tree;</div>
<div class="line">When the Soothsayers saw this sight full rare,</div>
<div class="line i2">  They did foretell th’ approach of th’ enemie.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That which Herodotus, Pausanias, Dio Cassius, Plutarch,
Julius Cæsar, Julius Capitolinus, and other historians with
greater observation then reason have confirmed. Saon
Acrephniensis, when he could by no means finde the oracle
Trophonius; Pausanias in his œticks saith he was lead
thither by a swarm of Bees. Moreover, Plutarch, Pausanias,
Ælian, Alex. Alexandrinus, Theocritus and Textor are
authors that Jupiter Melitæus, Hiero of Syracuse, Plato,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_181" title="181"></a><!--182.png-->
Pindar, Apius Comatus, Xenophon, and last of all Ambrose,
when their nurses were absent, had honey dropt into their
mouths by Bees, and so were preserved.”<a id="Marker_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="marker">616</a></p>

<p>In East Norfolk, England, if Bees swarm on rotten wood,
it is considered portentous of a death in the family.<a id="Marker_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="marker">617</a> This
superstition is as old at least as the time of Gay, for, among
the signs that foreshadowed the death of Blonzelind, it is
mentioned:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Swarmed on a rotten stick the Bees I spy’d</div>
<div class="line">Which erst I saw when Goody Dobson dy’d.<a id="Marker_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="marker">618</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Ireland, the mere swarming of Bees is looked upon as
prognosticating a death in the family of the owner.</p>

<p>In parts of England it is believed, that if a swarm of
Bees come to a house, and are not claimed by their owner,
there will be a death in the family that hives them.<a id="Marker_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="marker">619</a></p>

<p>It is a very ancient superstition that Bees, by their acute
sense of smell, quickly detect an unchaste woman, and strive
to make her infamy known by stinging her immediately. In
a pastoral of Theocritus, the shepherd in a pleasant mood
tells Venus to go away to Anchises to be well stung by Bees
for her lewd behavior.</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Now go thy way to Ida mount&mdash;</div>
<div class="line i2">  Go to Anchises now,</div>
<div class="line">Where mighty oaks, where banks along</div>
<div class="line i2">  Of square Cypirus grow,</div>
<div class="line">Where hives and hollow trunks of trees,</div>
<div class="line i2">  With honey sweet abound,</div>
<div class="line">Where all the place with humming noise</div>
<div class="line i2">  Of busie Bees resound.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Incontinence in men, as well as unchastity in women, was
thought to be punished by these little insects. Thus in the
lines of Pindarus:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Thou painful Bee, thou pretty creature,</div>
<div class="line">Who honey-combs six angled, as the be,</div>
<div class="line">With feet doest frame, false Phœcus and impure,</div>
<div class="line">With sting has prickt for his lewd villany.<a id="Marker_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="marker">620</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_182" title="182"></a><!--183.png-->

<p>Pliny says: “Certain it is, that if a menstruous woman do
no more but touch a Bee-hive, all the Bees will be gone and
never more come to it again.”<a id="Marker_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="marker">621</a></p>

<p>In Western Pennsylvania, it is believed that Bees will invariably
sting red-haired persons as soon as they approach
the hives.</p>

<p>It is a common opinion that Bees in rough and boisterous
weather, and particularly in a violent storm, carry a stone
in their legs, in order to preserve themselves by its weight
against the power of the wind. Its antiquity is also great,
for in the writings of Plutarch we find an instance of this
remarkable wisdom. “The Bees of Candi,” says this philosopher,
“being about to double a point or cape lying into
the sea, which is much exposed to the winds, they ballase
(ballast) themselves with small grit or petty stones, for to
be able to endure the weather, and not be carried away
against their wills with the winds through their lightness
otherwise.”<a id="Marker_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="marker">622</a></p>

<p>Virgil, too, about a century earlier, mentions this curious
notion in the following lines:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">And as when empty barks on billows float,</div>
<div class="line">With sandy ballast sailors trim the boat;</div>
<div class="line">So Bees bear gravel stones, whose poising weight</div>
<div class="line">Steers through the whistling winds their steady flight.<a id="Marker_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="marker">623</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Swammerdam, who has noticed this belief of the ancients,
makes the following remarks: “But this, as Clutius justly
observes, has not been hitherto remarked by any Bee-keeper,
nor indeed have I myself ever seen it. Yet I should think
that there may be some truth in this matter, and probably
a certain observation, which I shall presently mention, has
given rise to the story. There is a species of wild Bees not
unlike the smallest kind of the Humble-Bee, which, as they
are accustomed to build their nests near stone walls, and
construct their habitations of stone and clay, sometimes carry
such large stones that it is scarcely credible by what means
so tender insects can sustain so great a load, and that even
flying while they are obliged also to support their own body.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_183" title="183"></a><!--184.png-->
Their nest by this means is often so heavy as to weigh one
or two pounds.”<a id="Marker_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="marker">624</a></p>

<p>It was the general opinion of antiquity that Bees were
produced from the putrid bodies of cattle. Varro says they
are called Βουγόναι by the Greeks, because they arise from
petrified bullocks. In another place he mentions their
rising from these putrid animals, and quotes the authority
of Archelaus, who says Bees proceed from bullocks, and
wasps from horses.<a id="Marker_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="marker">625</a> Virgil, however, is much more satisfactory,
for he gives us the recipe in all its details for producing
these insects:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">First, in a place, by nature close, they build</div>
<div class="line">A narrow flooring, gutter’d, wall’d, and til’d.</div>
<div class="line">In this, four windows are contriv’d, that strike</div>
<div class="line">To the four winds oppos’d, their beams oblique.</div>
<div class="line">A steer of two years old they take, whose head</div>
<div class="line">Now first with burnished horns begins to spread:</div>
<div class="line">They stop his nostrils, while he strives in vain</div>
<div class="line">To breathe free air, and struggles with his pain.</div>
<div class="line">Knock’d down, he dies: his bowels bruis’d within,</div>
<div class="line">Betray no wound on his unbroken skin.</div>
<div class="line">Extended thus, in his obscene abode,</div>
<div class="line">They leave the beast; but first sweet flowers are strow’d</div>
<div class="line">Beneath his body, broken boughs and thyme,</div>
<div class="line">And pleasing Cassia, just renew’d in prime.</div>
<div class="line">This must be done, ere spring makes equal day,</div>
<div class="line">When western winds on curling waters play;</div>
<div class="line">Ere painted meads produce their flowery crops,</div>
<div class="line">Or swallows twitter on the chimney tops.</div>
<div class="line">The tainted blood, in this close prison pent,</div>
<div class="line">Begins to boil, and thro’ the bones ferment.</div>
<div class="line">Then wond’rous to behold, new creatures rise,</div>
<div class="line">A moving mass at first, and short of thighs;</div>
<div class="line">Till shooting out with legs, and imp’d with wings,</div>
<div class="line">The grubs proceed to Bees with pointed stings:</div>
<div class="line">And more and more affecting air, they try</div>
<div class="line">Their tender pinions and begin to fly.<a id="Marker_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="marker">626</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This absurd notion was also promulgated by the great
English chronicler, Hollingshed; for, says this author,
“Hornets, waspes, Bees, and such like, whereof we have
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_184" title="184"></a><!--185.png-->
great store, and of which an opinion is conceived, that the
first doo breed of the corruption of dead horses, the second
of pears and apples corrupted, and the last of kine and
oxen; which may be true, especiallie the first and latter in
some parts of the beast, and not their whole substances, as
also in the second, sith we never have waspes but when our
fruit beginneth to wax ripe.”<a id="Marker_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="marker">627</a></p>

<p>To conclude the history of this belief, the following remarks
of the learned Swammerdam will not be inappropriate.
He says: “It is probable that the not rightly understanding
Samson’s adventure of the Lion, gave rise to the
popular opinion of Bees springing from dead Lions, Oxen,
and Horses; and this opinion may have been considerably
strengthened, and indeed in a manner confirmed, by the
great number of Worms that are often found during the
summer months in the carcasses of such animals, especially
as these Worms somewhat resemble those produced from
the eggs of Bees. However ridiculous this opinion must
appear, many great men have not been ashamed to adopt
and defend it. The industrious Goedaert has ventured to
ascribe the origin of Bees to certain dunghill Worms, and
the learned de Mei joins with him in this opinion; though
neither of them had any observation to ground their belief
upon, but that of the external resemblance between the Bee
and a certain kind of Fly produced from these Worms.”<a id="Marker_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="marker">628</a></p>

<p>The opinion that stolen Bees will not thrive, but pine away
and die, is almost universal.<a id="Marker_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="marker">629</a> It is, too, of reverend antiquity,
for Pliny mentions it: “It is a common received
opinion, that Rue will grow the better if it be filched out of
another man’s garden; and it is as ordinarie a saying that
stolen Bees will thrive worst.”<a id="Marker_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="marker">630</a></p>

<p>In South Northamptonshire, England, there is a superstition
that Bees will not thrive in a quarrelsome family.<a id="Marker_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="marker">631</a>
It might be well to promulgate this and the next preceding
superstition. This prevails among us.</p>

<p>In Hampshire, England, it is a common saying that Bees
are idle or unfortunate at their work whenever there are
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_185" title="185"></a><!--186.png-->
wars. A very curious observer and fancier says that this
has been the case from the time of the movements in France,
Prussia, and Hungary, up to the present time.<a id="Marker_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="marker">632</a></p>

<p>In Bishopsbourne, England, there prevails the singular
superstition of informing the Bees of any great public event
that takes place, else they will not thrive so well.<a id="Marker_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="marker">633</a></p>

<p>In Monmouthshire, England, the peasantry entertain so
great a veneration for their Bees, that, says Bucke, some
years since, they were accustomed to go to their hives on
Christmas eve at twelve o’clock, in order to listen to their
humming; which elicited, as they believed, a much more
agreeable music than at any other period; since, at that
time, they celebrated, in the best manner they could, the
morning of Christ’s nativity.<a id="Marker_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="marker">634</a></p>

<p>Sampson, in his Statistical Survey of the County of Londonderry,
1802, p. 436, says that there “Bees must not be
given away, but sold; otherwise neither the giver nor the
taker will have <i>luck</i>.”<a id="Marker_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="marker">635</a></p>

<p>A clergyman in Devonshire, England, informs us that
when any Devonian makes a purchase of Bees, the payment
is never made in money, but in things (corn, for instance)
to the value of the sum agreed upon; and the Bees are
never removed but on a Good Friday.<a id="Marker_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="marker">636</a> In western Pennsylvania,
it is thought by some of the old farmers that the
vender of the Bees must be away from home when the hive
is taken away, else the Bees will not thrive.</p>

<p>Another superstition is that if a swarm of Bees be met
with in an open field away from any house, it is useless to
hive them, for they will never do a bit of good.</p>

<p>In many parts of England, a popular opinion is that
when Bees remove or go away from their hives, the owner
of them will die soon after.<a id="Marker_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="marker">637</a></p>

<p>It is commonly believed among us that if Bees come to a
house, it forebodes good luck and prosperity; and, on the
contrary, if they go away, bad luck.</p>

<p>A North German custom and superstition is, that if the
master of the house dies, a person must go to the Beehive,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_186" title="186"></a><!--187.png-->
knock, and repeat these words: “The master is dead, the
master is dead,” else the Bees will fly away.<a id="Marker_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="marker">638</a> This superstition
prevails also in England, Lithuania, and in France.<a id="Marker_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="marker">639</a></p>

<p>[Some years since, observes a correspondent of the Athenæum,
quoted by Brande, a gentleman at a dinner table
happened to mention that he was surprised, on the death of
a relative, by his servant inquiring “whether his master
would inform the Bees of the event, or whether <i>he</i> should
do so.” On asking the meaning of so strange a question,
the servant assured him that Bees ought always to be informed
of a death in a family, or they would resent the
neglect by deserting the hive. This gentleman resides in
the Isle of Ely, and the anecdote was told in Suffolk; and
one of the party present, a few days afterward, took the
opportunity of testing the prevalence of this strange notion
by inquiring of a cottager who had lately lost a relative,
and happened to complain of the loss of her Bees, “whether
she had told them all she ought to do?” She immediately
replied, “Oh, yes; when my aunt died I told every skep
(<i>i.e.</i> hive) myself, and put them.…</p>

<p>“Into mourning.” I have since ascertained the existence
of the same superstition in Cornwall, Devonshire (where I
have seen black crape put round the hive, or on a small
black stick by its side), and Yorkshire. It probably exists
in every part of the kingdom.… The mode of
communicating is by whispering the fact to each hive separately.…
In Oxford I was told that if a man and wife
quarreled, the Bees would leave them.]<a id="Marker_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="marker">640</a></p>

<p>“In some parts of Suffolk,” says Bucke, “the peasants
believe, when any member of their family dies, that, unless
the Bees are put in mourning by placing a piece of black
cloth, cotton or silk, on the top of the hives, the Bees will
either die or fly away.</p>

<p>“In Lithuania, when the master or mistress dies, one of
the first duties performed is that of giving notice to the
Bees, by rattling the keys of the house at the doors of their
hives. Unless this be done, the Lithuanians imagine the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_187" title="187"></a><!--188.png-->
cattle will die; the Bees themselves perish, and the trees
wither.”<a id="Marker_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="marker">641</a></p>

<p>At Bradfield, if Bees are not invited to funerals, it is believed
they will die.<a id="Marker_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="marker">642</a></p>

<p>In the Living Librarie, Englished by John Molle, 1621,
p. 283, we read: “Who would beleeve without superstition
(if experience did not make it credible), that most commonly
all the Bees die in their hives, if the master or mistress of
the house chance to die, except the hives be presently removed
into some other place? And yet I know this hath
hapned to folke no way stained with superstition.”<a id="Marker_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="marker">643</a></p>

<p>A similar superstition is, that Beehives belonging to deceased
persons should be turned over the moment when the
corpse is taken out of the house.<a id="Marker_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="marker">644</a> No consequence is given
for the non-performance of this rite.</p>

<p>The following item is clipped from the Argus, a London
newspaper, printed Sept. 13, 1790: “A superstitious custom
prevails at every funeral in Devonshire, of turning round the
Bee-hives that belonged to the deceased, if he had any, and
that at the moment the corpse is carrying out of the house.
At a funeral some time since, at Columpton, of a rich old
farmer, a laughable circumstance of this sort occurred: for,
just as the corpse was placed in the hearse, and the horsemen,
to a large number, were drawn in order for the procession
of the funeral, a person called out, ‘Turn the Bees,’
when a servant who had no knowledge of such a custom,
instead of turning the hives about, lifted them up, and then
laid them down on their sides. The Bees, thus hastily invaded,
instantly attacked and fastened on the horses and
their riders. It was in vain they galloped off, the Bees as
precipitately followed, and left their stings as marks of indignation.
A general confusion took place, attended with
loss of hats, wigs, etc., and the corpse during the conflict
was left unattended; nor was it till after a considerable
time that the funeral attendants could be rallied, in order to
proceed to the interment of their deceased friend.”<a id="Marker_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="marker">645</a></p>

<p>After the death of a member of a family, it has frequently
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_188" title="188"></a><!--189.png-->
been asserted that the Bees sometimes take their
loss so much to heart as to alight upon the coffin whenever
it is exposed. A clergyman told Langstroth, that he attended
a funeral, where, as soon as the coffin was brought
from the house, the Bees gathered upon it so as to excite
much alarm. Some years after this occurrence, being engaged
in varnishing a table, the Bees alighted upon it in
such numbers as to convince the reverend gentleman that
love of varnish, rather than sorrow or respect for the dead,
was the occasion of their conduct at the funeral.<a id="Marker_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="marker">646</a></p>

<p>The following is an extract from a <i>Tour through Brittany</i>,
published in the Cambrian <i>Quarterly Magazine</i>, vol. ii.
p. 215: “If there are Bees kept at the house where a marriage
feast is celebrated, care is always taken to dress up
their hives in red, which is done by placing upon them
pieces of scarlet cloth, or one of some such bright color;
the Bretons imagining that the Bees would forsake their
dwellings if they were not made to participate in the rejoicings
of their owners: in like manner they are all put
into mourning when a death occurs in a family.”<a id="Marker_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="marker">647</a></p>

<p>In the Magazine of Natural History we find the following
instance of singing psalms to Bees to make them thrive:
“When in Bedfordshire lately, we were informed of an old
man who sang a psalm last year in front of some hives
which were not doing well, but which, he said, would thrive
in consequence of that ceremony. Our informant could not
state whether this was a local or individual superstition.”<a id="Marker_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="marker">648</a></p>

<p>It is commonly said that if you sing to your Bees before
they swarm, it will prevent their leaving your premises
when they do swarm.</p>

<p>Peter Rotharmel, a western Pennsylvanian, had a singular
notion that no man could have at one time a hundred
hives of Bees. He declared he had often as many as ninety-nine,
but could never add another to them.<a id="Marker_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="marker">649</a> I have since
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_189" title="189"></a><!--190.png-->
learned that this is not an individual superstition, but one
that pretty generally prevails.</p>

<p>The Apiarians of Bedfordshire, England, have a custom
of, as they call it, ringing their swarms with the door-key and
the frying-pan; and if a swarm settles on another’s premises,
it is irrecoverable by the owner, unless he can prove the
ringing, but it becomes the property of that person upon
whose premises it settles.<a id="Marker_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="marker">650</a></p>

<p>The practice of beating pans, and making a great noise
to induce a swarm of Bees to settle, is, at least, as old as
the time of Virgil. He thus mentions it:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">But when thou seest a swarming cloud arise,</div>
<div class="line">That sweeps aloft, and darkens all the skies:</div>
<div class="line">The motions of their hasty flight attend;</div>
<div class="line">And know to floods, or woods, their airy march they bend.</div>
<div class="line">Then melfoil beat, and honey-suckles pound,</div>
<div class="line">With these alluring savors strew the ground,</div>
<div class="line">And mix with tinkling brass the cymbal’s drowning sound.<a id="Marker_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="marker">651</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But concerning this practice, Langstroth says: “It is probably
not a whit more efficacious than the hideous noises of
some savage tribes, who, imagining that the sun, in an
eclipse, has been swallowed by an enormous dragon, resort
to such means to compel his snakeship to disgorge their
favorite luminary.”<a id="Marker_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="marker">652</a></p>

<p>Dr. Toner, the author of that very interesting little work,
“Maternal Instinct or Love,” informs me that when a boy
he witnessed a mode of alluring a swarm of Bees to settle,
performed by a German man and his wife, which struck him
at the time as being remarkable, and which was as follows:
Having first put some pig-manure upon the hive into which
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_190" title="190"></a><!--191.png-->
they wished the Bees to go, they ran to and fro under the
swarm, singing a monotonous German hymn; and this they
continued till the Bees were settled and hived.</p>

<p>Another strange mode of alluring Bees into a new hive is
practiced near Gloucester, England, but only when all the
usual ways of preparing hives fail; it is this: When a swarm
is to be hived, instead of moistening the inside of the hive
with honey, or sugar and water, the Bee-master throws into
it, inverted, about a pint of beans, which he causes a sow to
devour, and immediately then, it is said, will the Bees take
to it.<a id="Marker_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="marker">653</a></p>

<p>Pliny, as follows, incidentally mentions another curious
mode of preparing the hives to best suit the Bees: “Touching
Baulme, which the Greeks call Melittis or Melissophyllon:
if Bee-hives be rubbed all over and besmeared with the
juice thereof, the Bees will never go away; for there is
not a flower whereof they be more desirous and faine than
of it.”<a id="Marker_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="marker">654</a></p>

<p>Borlase, in his Antiquities of Cornwall, p. 168, tells us of
another strange practice in the hiving of Bees. He says:
“The Cornish, to this day, invoke the spirit of Browny,
when their Bees swarm; and they think that their crying
Browny, Browny, will prevent them from returning into
the former hive, and make them pitch and form a new
colony.”<a id="Marker_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="marker">655</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Thomas P. Hunt, of Wyoming, Pa., has devised
an amusing plan, by which he says he can, at all times, prevent
a swarm of Bees from leaving his premises. Before his
stocks swarm, he collects a number of dead Bees, and, stringing
them with a needle and thread, as worms are strung for
catching eels, makes of them a ball about the size of an egg,
leaving a few strands loose. By carrying&mdash;fastened to a
pole&mdash;this “<i>Bee-bob</i>” about his Apiary, when the Bees are
swarming, or by placing it in some central position, he invariably
secures every swarm.<a id="Marker_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="marker">656</a></p>

<p>The barbarous practice of killing Bees for their honey,
not yet entirely abolished, did not exist in the time of Aristotle,
Varro, Columella, and Pliny. The old cultivators
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_191" title="191"></a><!--192.png-->
took only what their Bees could spare, killing no stocks except
such as were feeble or diseased. The following epitaph,
taken from a German work, might well be placed over every
pit of these brimstoned insects:</p>

<p class="epitaph">
<span class="small-caps">Here Rests</span>,<br />

<span class="smaller">CUT OFF FROM USEFUL LABOR,<br />

A COLONY OF<br /></span>

INDUSTRIOUS BEES,<br />

<span class="smaller">BASELY MURDERED<br />

BY ITS<br />

UNGRATEFUL AND IGNORANT<br /></span>

OWNER.
</p>

<p>To the epitaph also may be appended Thomson’s verses:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Ah, see, where robbed and murdered in that pit,</div>
<div class="line">Lies the still heaving hive! at evening snatched,</div>
<div class="line">Beneath the cloud of guilt-concealing night,</div>
<div class="line">And fixed o’er sulphur! while, not dreaming ill,</div>
<div class="line">The happy people, in their waxen cells,</div>
<div class="line">Sat tending public cares.</div>
<div class="line">Sudden, the dark, oppressive steam ascends,</div>
<div class="line">And, used to milder scents, the tender race,</div>
<div class="line">By thousands, tumble from their honied dome</div>
<div class="line">Into a gulf of blue sulphureous flame!<a id="Marker_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="marker">657</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is considered very cruel in Africa, as Campbell observes,
to kill Bees in order to obtain their honey, especially
as from flowers being there at all seasons, and most in winter,
they can live comfortably all the year round. A Hottentot,
who was accustomed to kill the Bees, was often reasoned
with by the humane to give up so cruel a practice, yet he
persisted in it till a circumstance occurred which determined
him to relinquish it. He had a water-mill for grinding his
corn, which went very slowly, from the smallness of the
stream which turned it; consequently the flour dropped very
gently. For some time much less than usual came into the
sack, the cause of which he could not discover. At length
he found that a great part of his flour, as it was ground, was
carried off by the Bees to their hives: on examining this, he
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_192" title="192"></a><!--193.png-->
found it contained only his flour, and no honey. This robbery
made him resolve to destroy no more Bees when their
honey was taken, considering their conduct in robbing him
of his property as a just punishment to him for his cruelty.
The gentleman who related this story, Mr. Campbell says,
was a witness to the Bees robbing the mill.<a id="Marker_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="marker">658</a></p>

<p>An old English proverb, relative to the swarming of
Bees, <span class="no-wrap">is,&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">A swarm of Bees in May,</div>
<div class="line">Is worth a load of hay;</div>
<div class="line">A swarm of Bees in June,</div>
<div class="line">Is worth a silver spoon;</div>
<div class="line">A swarm of Bees in July,</div>
<div class="line">Is not worth a fly.<a id="Marker_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="marker">659</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Tusser’s Five Hundred Points of Husbandry, under
the month of May, are these lines:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Take heed to thy Bees, that are ready to swarme,</div>
<div class="line">The losse thereof now is a crown’s worth of harme.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On which is the following observation in Tusser Redivivus,
1744, p. 62: “The tinkling after them with a warming-pan,
frying-pan, kettle, is of good use to let the neighbors
know you have a swarm in the air, which you claim wherever
it lights; but I believe of very little purpose to the reclaiming
of the Bees, who are thought to delight in no noise but
their own.”</p>

<p>Ill fortune attends the killing of Bees,&mdash;a common saying.
This, doubtless, arose from the thrift and usefulness
of these insects.</p>

<p>That swarms of Bees, or fields, houses, stalls of cattle, or
workshops, may not be affected by enchantment, Leontinus
says: “Dig in the hoof of the right side of a sable ass under
the threshold of the door, and pour on some liquid
pitchy resin, salt, Heracleotic origanum, cardamonium,
cumin, some fine bread, squills, a chaplet of white or of
crimson wool, the chaste tree, vervain, sulphur, pitchy
torches; and lay on some amaranthus every month, and lay
on the mould; and, having scattered seeds of different kinds,
let them remain.”<a id="Marker_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="marker">660</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_193" title="193"></a><!--194.png-->

<p>To cure the stings of Bees, we have the following remedies:
“Rue,” says Pliny, “is an hearbe as medicinable as the best
… and is available against the stings of Bees, Hornets,
and Wasps, and against the poison of the Cantharides and
Salamanders.<a id="Marker_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="marker">661</a></p>

<p>“Yea, and it is an excellent thing for them that be stung,
to take the very Bees in drinke; for it is an approved
cure.<a id="Marker_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="marker">662</a></p>

<p>“Baulme is a most present remedy not only against their
stings, but also of Wespes, Spiders, and Scorpions.<a id="Marker_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="marker">663</a></p>

<p>“The Laurell, both leafe, barke, and berrie, is by nature
hot; and applied as a liniment, be singular good for the
pricke or sting of Wasps, Hornets, and Bees.<a id="Marker_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="marker">664</a></p>

<p>“For the sting of Bees, Wasps, and Hornets, the Howlat
(owlet) is counted a soveraigne thing, by a certaine antipathie
in nature.<a id="Marker_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="marker">665</a></p>

<p>“Moreover, as many as have about them the bill of a
Woodspeck (Woodpecker) when they come to take honey
out of the hive, shall not be stung by Bees.”<a id="Marker_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="marker">666</a></p>

<p>It is said that if a man suffers himself to be stung by Bees,
he will find that the poison will produce less and less effect
upon his system, till, finally, like Mithridates of old, he will
appear to almost thrive upon poison itself. When Langstroth
first became interested in Bees, according to his statement,
a sting was quite a formidable thing, the pain being
often intense, and the wound swelling so as sometimes to
obstruct his sight. But, at length, however, the pain was
usually slight, and, if the sting was quickly extracted, no
unpleasant consequences ensued, even if no remedies were
used. Huish speaks of seeing the bald head of Bonner, a
celebrated practical Apiarian, covered with stings, which
seemed to produce upon him no unpleasant effects. The
Rev. Mr. Kleine advises beginners to suffer themselves to be
stung frequently, assuring them that, in two seasons, their
systems will become accustomed to the poison. An old
English Apiarian advises a person who has been stung, to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_194" title="194"></a><!--195.png-->
catch as speedily as possible another Bee, and make it sting
on the same spot.<a id="Marker_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="marker">667</a></p>

<p>It is generally believed among our boys that if the part
stung by a Bee be rubbed with the leaves of three different
plants at the same time, the pain will be relieved.</p>

<p>Willsford, in his Nature’s Secrets, p. 134, says: “Bees,
in fair weather, not wandering far from their hives, presage
the approach of some stormy weather.… Wasps, Hornets,
and Gnats, biting more eagerly than they used to do, is a
sign of rainy weather.”<a id="Marker_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="marker">668</a></p>

<p>The prognostication drawn from a flight of Bees, in which
there is doubtless much truth, appears from the following
lines to have been known to Virgil:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i12">                Nor dare they stay,</div>
<div class="line">When rain is promised, or a stormy day:</div>
<div class="line">But near the city walls their watering take,</div>
<div class="line">Nor forage far, but short excursions make.<a id="Marker_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="marker">669</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bees were employed as the symbol of Epeses; they are
common also on coins of Elyrus, Julis, and Præsus.<a id="Marker_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="marker">670</a></p>

<p>One of the most remarkable facts in the history of Bees
is that passage in the Bible<a id="Marker_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="marker">671</a> about the swarm of these insects
and honey in the carcass of the lion slain by Samson.
Some look upon it as a paradox, others as altogether incredible;
but it admits of easy explanation. The lion had
been dead some little time before the Bees had taken up
their abode in the carcass, for it is expressly stated that
“after a time,” Samson returned and saw the Bees and
honey in the carcass, so that “if,” as Oedman has well observed,
“any one here represents to himself a corrupt and
putrid carcass, the occurrence ceases to have any true similitude,
for it is well known in these countries, at certain seasons
of the year, the heat will in twenty-four hours so completely
dry up the moisture of dead animals, and that without
their undergoing decomposition, that their bodies long
remain, like mummies, unaltered, and entirely free from
offensive odor.” To the foregoing quotation we may add
that very probably the larvæ of flies, ants, and other insects,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_195" title="195"></a><!--196.png-->
which at the time when Bees swarm, are to be found in
great numbers, would help to consume the carcass, and
leave perhaps in a short time little else than a skeleton.<a id="Marker_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="marker">672</a></p>

<p>An instance of Bees tenanting a dead body is found in
the following passage from the writings of Herodotus:
“Now the Amathusians, having cut off the head of Onesilus,
because he had besieged them, took it to Amatheus, and
suspended it over the gates; and when the head was suspended,
and had become hollow, a swarm of Bees entered
it, and filled it with honey-comb. When this happened, the
Amathusians consulted the oracle respecting it, and an
answer was given them, ‘that they should take down the
head and bury it, and sacrifice annually to Onesilus, as to a
hero; and if they did so, it would turn out better for them.’
The Amathusians did accordingly, and continued to do so
until my time.”<a id="Marker_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="marker">673</a></p>

<p>Another singular instance is mentioned by Napier in his
Excursions on the shores of the Mediterranean: “Among
this pretty collection of natural curiosities (in the cemetery
of Algesiras), one in particular attracted our attention;
this was the contents of a small uncovered coffin in which
lay a child, the cavity of the chest exposed and tenanted by
an industrious colony of Bees. The comb was rapidly progressing,
and I suppose, according to the adage of the poet,
they were adding sweets to the sweet, if not perfume to the
violet.”<a id="Marker_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="marker">674</a></p>

<p>Butler, in his Feminine Monarchie, narrates the following
curious story: “<i>Paulus Jovius</i> affirmeth that in <i>Muscovia</i>,
there are found in the woods &amp; wildernesses great lakes of
honey, which the Bees have forsaken, in the hollow truncks
of marvelous huge trees. In so much that hony &amp; waxe
are the most certaine commodities of that countrie. Where,
by that occasion, he setteth down the storie reported by
<i>Demetrius</i> a <i>Muscovite</i> ambassador sent to Rome. A
neighbor of mine (saith he) searching in the woods for hony
slipt downe into a great hollow tree, and there sunk into a
lake of hony vp to his brest: where when he had stucke
faste two daies calling and crying out in vaine for helpe, because
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_196" title="196"></a><!--197.png-->
no bodie in the meane while came nigh that solitarie
place; at length when he was out of all hope of life, hee
was strangely delivered by the means of a great beare:
which coming thither about the same businesse that he did,
and smelling the hony stirred with his striving, clambered
vp to the top of the tree, &amp; thence began to let himselfe
downe backward into it. The man bethinking himself, and
knowing the worst was but death, which in that place he
was sure of, beclipt the beare fast with both his hands aboit
the loines, and withall made an outcry as lowd as he could.
The beare being thus sodainely affrighted, what with the
handling, &amp; what with the noise, made vp againe withal
speed possible: the man held, &amp; the beare pulled, vntil with
main force he had drawne <i>Dun out of the mire:</i> &amp; then
being let go, away he trots <i>more afeard than hurt</i>, leaving
the smeered swaine in a joyful feare.”<a id="Marker_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="marker">675</a></p>

<p>By the Chinese writers, the composition of the characters
for the Bee, Ant, and Mosquito, respectively, denote the
awl insect, the <i>righteous</i> insect, and the <i>lettered</i> insect;
referring thereby to the sting of the first, the orderly marching
and subordination of the second, and the letter-like
markings on the wings of the last.<a id="Marker_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="marker">676</a></p>

<p>In May, 1653, the remains of Childeric, King of the
Franks, who died <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 481, and was buried at Tournay,
were discovered; and among the medals, coins, and books,
which were found in his tomb, were also found above three
hundred figures of, as Chiflet says, Bees, all of gold. Some
of these figures were toads, crescents, lilies, spear-heads, and
such like, but Chiflet, after much labor and research, was
fully convinced they were Bees; and, more than that, determines
them to be the source whence the <i>Fleur de lis</i> in
the Arms of France were afterward derived. Montfaucon,
however, did not hesitate to say they were nothing more
than ornaments of the horse-furniture.<a id="Marker_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="marker">677</a></p>

<p>Napoleon I. and II. are said to have had their imperial
robes embroidered with golden Bees, as claiming official
descent from Carolus Magnus, who is said to have worn
them on his coat of arms.<a id="Marker_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="marker">678</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_197" title="197"></a><!--198.png-->

<p>On a Continental forty-five dollar bill, issued on the 14th
of January, 1779, is represented an Apiary in which two
Beehives are visible, and Bees are seen swarming about.
The motto is “Sic floret Respublica&mdash;Thus flourishes the
Republic.” It conveys the simple lesson that by industry
and frugality the Republic would prosper.<a id="Marker_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="marker">679</a></p>

<p>Bees in the heroic ages it appears were not confined in
hives; for, whenever Homer describes them, it is either
where they are streaming forth from a rock,<a id="Marker_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="marker">680</a> or settling in
bands and clusters on the spring flowers. Hesiod, however,
soon after makes mention of a hive where he is uncourteously
comparing women to drones:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">As when within their well-roof’d hives the Bees</div>
<div class="line">Maintain the mischief-working drones at ease,</div>
<div class="line">Their task pursuing till the golden sun</div>
<div class="line">Down to the western wave his course hath run,</div>
<div class="line">Filling their shining combs, while snug within</div>
<div class="line">Their fragrant cells, the drones, with idle din</div>
<div class="line">As princes revel o’er their unpaid bowls,</div>
<div class="line">On others’ labors cheer their worthless souls.<a id="Marker_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="marker">681</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It may be surprising to many to know that Bees were not
originally natives of this country. But such is the case;
the first planters never saw any. The English first introduced
them into Boston, and in 1670, they were carried over
the Alleghany Mountains by a hurricane.<a id="Marker_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="marker">682</a> Since that time,
it has been remarked they betray an invariable tendency for
migrating southward.<a id="Marker_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="marker">683</a></p>

<p>Bees for a long time were known to our Indians by the
name of “English Flies;”<a id="Marker_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="marker">684</a> and they consider them, says
Irving, as the harbinger of the white man, as the buffalo is
of the red man, and say that in proportion as the Bee advances,
the Indian and the buffalo retire.<a id="Marker_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="marker">685</a></p>

<p>Longfellow, in his Song of Hiawatha, in describing the
advent of the European to the New World, makes his
Indian warrior say of the Bee and the white clover:</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_198" title="198"></a><!--199.png-->


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Wheresoe’er they move, before them</div>
<div class="line">Swarms the stinging fly, the Ahmo,</div>
<div class="line">Swarms the Bee, the honey-maker;</div>
<div class="line">Wheresoe’er they tread, beneath them</div>
<div class="line">Springs a flower unknown among us,</div>
<div class="line">Springs the White Man’s Foot in blossom.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many Apiarians contend that newly-settled countries are
most favorable to the Bee; and an old German adage runs
thus:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Bells’ ding dong,</div>
<div class="line">And choral song,</div>
<div class="line">Deter the bee</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">But hoot of owl,</div>
<div class="line">And “wolf’s long howl”</div>
<div class="line">Incite to moil</div>
<div class="line">And steady toil.<a id="Marker_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="marker">686</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hector St. John, in his Letters, gives the following curious
account of the method which he employed in discovering
Bees in our woods in early times: Provided with a blanket,
some provisions, wax, vermilion, honey, and a small pocket
compass, he proceeded to such woods as were at a considerable
distance from the settlements. Then examining if they
abounded with large trees, he kindled a small fire on some
flat stones, close by which putting some wax, and, on another
stone near by, dropping distinct drops of honey, which he
encircled with the vermilion. He then retired to carefully
watch if any Bees appeared. The smell of the burnt wax,
if there were any Bees in the neighborhood, would unavoidably
attract them; and, finding the honey, would necessarily
become tinged with the vermilion, in attempting to get at
it. Next, fixing his compass, he found out the direction of
the hives by the flight of the loaded Bees, which is invariably
straight when they are returning home. Then timing with
his watch the absence of the Bee till it would come back for
a second load, and recognizing it by the vermilion, he could
generally guess pretty closely to the distance traversed by it
in the given time. Knowing then the direction and the
probable distance, he seldom failed in going directly to the
right tree. In this way he sometimes found as many as
eleven swarms in one season.<a id="Marker_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="marker">687</a></p>

<p>The shepherds of the Alps, as we learn from Sausure quoted
in the Insect Miscellanies, as soon as the snows are melted
on the sides of the mountains, transfer their flocks from the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_199" title="199"></a><!--200.png-->
valleys below to the fresh pasture revived by the summer
sun, in the natural parterres and patches of meadow-land
formed at the foot of crumbling rocks, and sheltered by them
from mountain storms; and so difficult sometimes is this
transfer to be accomplished, that the sheep have to be slung
by means of ropes from one cliff to another before they can
be stationed on the little grass-plot above.<a id="Marker_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="marker">688</a> A similar
artificial migration (if we may use the term), continues the
author of the Miscellanies, is effected in some countries by
the proprietors of Beehives, who remove them from one
district to another, that they may find abundance of flowers,
and by this means prolong the summer. Sometimes this
transfer is performed by persons forming an ambulatory establishment,
like that of a gipsy horde, and encamping
wherever flowers are found plentiful. Bee-caravans of this
kind are reported to be not uncommon in some districts of
Germany;<a id="Marker_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="marker">689</a> and in parts of Greece,<a id="Marker_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="marker">690</a> Italy, and France,<a id="Marker_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="marker">691</a> the
transportation of Bees was practiced from very early times.
But a more singular practice in such transportation was to
set the Beehives afloat in a canal or river, and we are informed
that, in France, one Bee-barge was built of capacity
enough for from sixty to one hundred hives, and by floating
gently down the river, the Bees had an opportunity of
gathering honey from the flowers along the banks.<a id="Marker_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="marker">692</a></p>

<p>An instance of Bees being kept in this singular manner is
found in the following quotation from the London Times,
1830: “As a small vessel was proceeding up the Channel
from the coast of Cornwall, and running near the land, some
of the sailors observed a swarm of Bees on an island; they
steered for it, landed, and took the Bees on board; succeeded
in hiving them immediately, and proceeded on their voyage;
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_200" title="200"></a><!--201.png-->
as they sailed along shore, the Bees constantly flew from the
vessel to the land, to collect honey, and returned again to
their moving hive; and this was continued all the way up
the Channel.”<a id="Marker_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="marker">693</a></p>

<p>In Lower Egypt, observes M. Maillet in his Description
of Egypt, where the blossoming of flowers is about six weeks
later than in the upper districts, the practice of transporting
Beehives is much followed. The hives are collected from different
villages along the banks, each being marked and numbered
by individual proprietors, to prevent future mistakes.
They are then arranged in pyramidal piles upon the boats
prepared to receive them, which, floating gradually down the
river, and stopping at certain stages of their passage, remain
there a longer or a shorter time, according to the produce
afforded by the surrounding country within two or
three leagues. In this manner the Bee-boats sail for three
months; the Bees, having culled the honey of the orange-flowers
in the Said, and of the Arabian jasmine and other
flowers in the more northern parts, are brought back to the
places whence they had been carried. This procures for
the Egyptians delicious honey and abundance of wax. The
proprietors in return pay the boatmen a recompense proportioned
to the number of hives which have been thus carried
about from one extremity of Egypt to the other.<a id="Marker_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="marker">694</a> The
celebrated traveler Niebuhr saw upon the Nile, between
Cairo and Damietta, a convoy of 4000 hives in their transit
from Upper Egypt to the coast of the Delta.<a id="Marker_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="marker">695</a></p>

<p>In the Bienenzeitung for 1854, p. 83, appears the following
statements: “Mr. Kaden, of Mayence, thinks that the
range of the Bee’s flight does not usually extend more than
three miles in all directions. Several years ago, a vessel,
laden with sugar, anchored off Mayence, and was soon
visited by the Bees of the neighborhood, which continued to
pass to and from the vessel from dawn to dark. One morning,
when the Bees were in full flight, the vessel sailed up
the river. For a short time, the Bees continued to fly as
numerously as before; but gradually the number diminished,
and, in course of half an hour, all had ceased to follow the
vessel, which had, meanwhile, sailed more than four miles.”<a id="Marker_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="marker">696</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_201" title="201"></a><!--202.png-->

<p>Aristomachus of Soli, says Pliny, made Bees his exclusive
study for a period of fifty-eight years; and Philiocus,
the Thracian, surnamed Agrius&mdash;“Wildman”&mdash;passed his
life in desert spots tending swarms of Bees.<a id="Marker_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="marker">697</a></p>

<p>Schomburgk says he saw, in his journey to the sources
of the Takutu, an Indian, who was the conjuror or piaiman
of his tribe, merely approach a nest of the wild Wampang-bees
(<i>Wampisiana camniba</i>), and knocking with his fingers
against it, drive out all the Bees without a single one injuring
him. The piaiman, Schomburgk remarks, drew his fingers
under the pits of his arms before he knocked against the hive.<a id="Marker_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="marker">698</a></p>

<p>Brue, in his first voyage to Siratic, in Africa, met with
what he called a “phenomenon” in a person entitling himself
the “King of the Bees.” His majesty accordingly came to
the boat of the traveler entirely covered with these insects,
and followed by thousands, over which he appeared to exercise
the most absolute authority. These Bees were never
known to injure either himself or those whom he took under
his protection.<a id="Marker_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="marker">699</a></p>

<p>Mr. Wildman, the most celebrated Bee-tamer, frequently
asserted that armed with his friendly Bees he was defensible
against the fiercest mastiffs; and, it is said, he actually did,
at Salisbury, encounter three yard-dogs one after the other.
The conditions of the engagement were, that he should have
notice of the dog being set at him. Accordingly the first
mastiff was set loose; and as he approached the man, two
Bees were detached, which immediately stung him, the one
on the nose, the other on the flank; upon receiving the
wounds, the dog retired very much daunted. After this, the
second dog entered the lists, and was foiled with the same
expedition as the first. The third dog was at last brought
against the champion, but the animal observing the ill success
of his brethren, would not attempt to sustain a combat; so,
in a cowardly manner, he retired with his tail between his
legs.</p>

<p>Many other remarkable anecdotes are told of this gentleman,
illustrating his wonderful control over Bees. He could
also, indeed, tame wasps and hornets, with almost the same
ease as he could Bees, and an instance is mentioned of his
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_202" title="202"></a><!--203.png-->
hiving a nest of hornets which hung at the top of the inside
of a high barn. He, however, was stung twice in this undertaking.</p>

<p>Mr. Wildman frequently exhibited himself with his head
and face almost covered with Bees, and with such a swarm
of them hanging down from his chin as to resemble a venerable
beard. In this extraordinary dress he was once brought
through the City of London sitting in a chair. Before Earl
Spencer, Mr. Wildman also made many wonderful performances.<a id="Marker_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="marker">700</a></p>

<p>Says Dr. Evans:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Such was the spell, which round a Wildman’s arm</div>
<div class="line">Twined in dark wreaths the fascinated swarm,</div>
<div class="line">Bright o’er his breast the glittering legions led,</div>
<div class="line">Or with a living garland bound his head.</div>
<div class="line">His dexterous hand, with firm but hurtless hold,</div>
<div class="line">Could seize the chief, known by her scales of gold,</div>
<div class="line">Prune, ’mid the wondering throng, her filmy wing,</div>
<div class="line">Or o’er her folds the silken fetter fling.<a id="Marker_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="marker">701</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Long experience has taught me,” says Mr. Wildman
himself, “that as soon as I turn up a hive, and give some
taps on the sides and bottom, the queen immediately appears.
Being accustomed to see her, I readily perceive her at the
first glance; and long practice has enabled me to seize her
instantly, with a tenderness that does not in the least endanger
her person. Being possessed of her, I can, without
exciting any resentment, slip her into my other hand, and
returning the hive to its place, hold her, till the Bees, missing
her, are all on the wing and in the utmost confusion.” It
was then, by placing the queen in view, he could make them
light wherever he pleased, from their great attachment to
her, and sometimes using a word of command to mystify the
spectators, he would cause them to settle on his head, and to
hang to his chin like a beard, from which he would order
them to his hand, or to an adjacent window. But, however
easy such feats may appear in theory, Mr. Wildman cautions
(probably with a view to deter rivals) those who are inexperienced
not to put themselves in danger of attempting to
imitate him. A liberated Roman slave, C.&nbsp;F. Cnesinus,
being accused before the tribunals of witchcraft, because his
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_203" title="203"></a><!--204.png-->
crops were more abundant than those of his neighbors,
produced as his witnesses some superior implements of
husbandry, and well fed oxen, and pointing to them said:
“These, Romans! are my instruments of witchcraft; but I
cannot show you my toil, my perseverance, and my anxious
cares.” “So,” says Wildman, “may I say, These, Britons!
are my instruments of witchcraft; but I cannot show you
my hours of attention to this subject, my anxiety and care
for these useful insects; nor can I communicate to you my
experience acquired during a course of years.”<a id="Marker_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="marker">702</a></p>

<p>Butler mentions two instances where the stings of Bees
have been fatal to “cattaile”:</p>

<p>“A horse,” he informs us, “in the heate of the day looking
over a hedge, on the other side whereof was a staule of
Bees, while hee stood nodding with his head, as his manner
is, because of the flies, the Bees fell vpon him and killed
him. Likewise I heard of a teeme that stretching against
a hedge overthrew a staule on the other side, and so two of
the horses were stung to death.”<a id="Marker_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="marker">703</a></p>

<p>Mungo Park and his party were twice seriously attacked
by large swarms of Bees. The first attack is mentioned in
the account of his first journey; the second in the account
of his second. The latter singular accident befell them in
1805, and is thus narrated in his journal: The coffle had
halted at a creek, and the asses had just been unloaded,
when some of his guide Isaaca’s people, being in search of
honey, unfortunately disturbed a large swarm of Bees near
their resting-place. The Bees came out in immense numbers,
and attacked men and beasts at the same time. Luckily,
most of the asses were loose, and galloped up the valley;
but the horses and people were very much stung, and
obliged to scamper off in all directions. The fire which had
been kindled for cooking, being deserted, spread, and set fire
to the bamboos, and the baggage had like to have been
burned. In fact, for half an hour the Bees seemed to have
completely put an end to the journey. In the evening when
they became less troublesome, and the cattle could be collected,
it was found that many of them were very much
stung, and swollen about the head. Three asses were missing;
one died in the course of the evening, and one next
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_204" title="204"></a><!--205.png-->
morning, and they were forced to leave one behind the next
day. Altogether six were lost, besides which, the guide
lost his horse, and many of the people were much stung
about the face and hands.<a id="Marker_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="marker">704</a></p>

<p>But in the Treasvrie of Avncient and Moderne Times, we
find the following: “Anthenor, writing of the Isle of Crete
(with whom also ioyneth Ælianus) saith, that a great multitude
of Bees chased al the dwellers out of a City, and vsed
their Houses instead of Hives.”<a id="Marker_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="marker">705</a></p>

<p>Montaigne mentions the following singular assistance
rendered by Bees to the inhabitants of Tamly: The Portuguese
having besieged the City of Tamly, in the territory
of Xiatine, the inhabitants of the place brought a great
many hives, of which there are great plenty in that place,
upon the wall; and with fire drove the Bees so furiously
upon the enemy that they gave over the enterprise, not being
able to stand their attacks and endure their stings: and so
the citizens, by this new sort of relief, gained liberty and
the victory with so wonderful a fortune, that at the return
of their defenders from the battle they found they had not
lost so much as one.<a id="Marker_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="marker">706</a></p>

<p>Lesser tells us that in 1525, during the confusion occasioned
by a time of war, a mob assembling in Hohnstein (in
Thuringia) attempted to plunder the house of the minister
of Elende; who having spoken to them with no effect, as a
last resort ordered his domestics to bring his Beehives, and
throw them in the midst of the furious mob. The desired
effect was instantaneous, for the mob dispersed immediately.<a id="Marker_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="marker">707</a></p>

<p>Bees have also been employed as an article of food. Knox
tells us that the natives of Ceylon, when they meet with a
swarm of Bees hanging on a tree, hold burning torches
under them to make them drop; and so catch and carry
them home, where they boil and eat them, in their estimation,
as excellent food.<a id="Marker_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="marker">708</a></p>

<p>Peter Martyr, speaking of the Caribbean Islands, says:
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_205" title="205"></a><!--206.png-->
“The Inhabitantes willingly eate the young Bees, rawe,
roasted, and sometimes sodden.”<a id="Marker_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="marker">709</a></p>

<p>Bancroft tells us that when the negroes of Guiana are
stung by Bees, they in revenge eat as many as they can
catch.<a id="Marker_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="marker">710</a></p>

<p>The following account of the Bee-eater of Selborne, England,
is by the Reverend, and very accurate naturalist, Gilbert
White: “We had in this village,” says he, “more
than twenty years ago (about 1765), an idiot boy, whom I
well remember, who, from a child, showed a strong propensity
to Bees: they were his food, his amusement, his sole
object; and as people of this cast have seldom more than
one point in view, so this lad exerted all his few faculties on
this one pursuit. In the winter he dozed away his time,
within his father’s house, by the fireside, in a kind of torpid
state, seldom departing from the chimney corner; but in the
summer he was all alert, and in quest of his game in the
fields and on sunny banks. Honey-bees, Humble-bees, and
Wasps were his prey, wherever he found them: he had no
apprehensions from their stings, but would seize <i>nudis
manibus</i>, and at once disarm them of their weapons, and
search their bodies for the sake of their honey-bags. Sometimes
he would fill his bosom between his shirt and his skin
with a number of these captives; and sometimes would
confine them in bottles. He was a very <i>Merops apiaster</i>,
or Bee-bird, and very injurious to men that kept Bees; for
he would slide into their Bee-gardens, and, sitting down before
the stools, would rap with his finger on the hives, and
so take the Bees as they came out. He has been known to
overturn hives for the sake of honey, of which he was passionately
fond. Where metheglin was making, he would
linger round the tubs and vessels, begging a draught of
what he called <i>Bee-wine</i>. As he ran about he used to
make a humming noise with his lips, resembling the buzzing
of Bees. This lad was lean and sallow, and of a cadaverous
complexion; and, except in his favorite pursuit, in which
he was wonderfully adroit, discovered no manner of understanding.”<a id="Marker_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="marker">711</a></p>

<p>There is a peculiar substance formed by a species of Bee

in the Orinoco country, which, says Captain Stedman, the
roosting tribes burn incessantly in their habitations, and
which effectually protects them from all winged insects.
They call it <i>Comejou;</i> Gumilla says it is neither earth nor
wax.<a id="Marker_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="marker">712</a></p>

<p>Concerning the medicinal virtues of Bees, Dr. James
says: “Their salts are very volatile, and highly exalted;
for this reason, when dry’d, powder’d, and taken internally,
they are diuretic and diaphoretic. If this powder is mixed
in unguents, with which the head is anointed, it is said to
cure the Alopecia, and to contribute to the growth of hair
upon bald places.”<a id="Marker_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="marker">713</a></p>

<p>Another, an old writer, says: “If Bees, when dead, are
dried to powder, and given to either man or beast, this
medicine will often give immediate ease in the most excruciating
pain, and remove a stoppage in the body when all
other means have failed.” A tea made by pouring boiling
water upon Bees has recently been prescribed, by high medical
authority, for violent strangury; while the poison of the
Bee, under the name of <i>apis</i>, is a great homœopathic
remedy.<a id="Marker_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="marker">714</a></p>

<p>Concerning wax, Dr. James says: “All wax is heating,
mollifying, and moderately incarning. It is mixed in sorbile
liquors as a remedy for dysentery; and ten bits, of the size
of a grain of millet, swallowed, prevent the curdling of milk
in the breast of nurses.”<a id="Marker_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="marker">715</a></p>

<p>[If we might credit the history of former times, says Jamieson,
in his Scottish Dictionary, sub. <i>Walx</i>, iv. 642&ndash;3, there
must have been a considerable demand for this article (wax)
for the purpose of witchcraft. It was generally found necessary,
it would seem, as the medium of inflicting pain on the
bodies of men.</p>

<p>“To some others at these times he teacheth, how to make
<i>pictures of waxe</i> or clay, that by the wasting thereof, the
persons that they beare the name of, may be continually
melted or dried away by continuall sickenesse.” K. James’s
Dæmonologie, B. II. c. 5.</p>

which they wished the person to suffer.</p>

<p>The same plan was adopted for inspiring another with
the ardor of love.</p>

</div>

<p>The same horrid rites were observed on the continent.
For Grilland (de Sortilegiis) says: Quidam solent apponere
<i>imaginem cerae</i> juxta ignem ardentem, completis sacrificiis,
de quibus supra, &amp; adhibere quasdam preces nefarias, &amp;
turpia verba, ut quemadmodum imago illa igne consumitur
&amp; liquescit, eodem modo cor mulieris amoris calore talis
viri feruenter ardeat, etc. Malleus Malefic. T.&nbsp;H., p. 232.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that these rites have been transmitted
from heathenism. Theocritus mentions them as
practiced by the Greeks in his time. For he introduces
Samoetha as using similar enchantments, partly for punishing,
and partly for regaining her faithless lover.</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="attribution"><i>Idylliums</i>, p. 12, 13.</div>
</div>


<p>Samoetha burns the bough in the name of her false lover,
and terms the wax <i>devoted</i>. With this the more modern
ritual of witchcraft corresponded. The name of the person,
represented by the image, was invoked. For according to
the narrative given concerning the witches of Pollock-shaws,
having bound the image on a spit, they “turned it before
the fire,&mdash;saying, as they turned it, <i>Sir George Maxwell,
Sir George Maxwell;</i> and that this was expressed by all
of them.” Glanvil’s Sadducismus, p. 391.</p>

<p>According to Grilland, the image was baptized in the
name of Beelzebub. Malleus, ut. sup., p. 229.</p>

<p>There is nothing analogous to the Grecian rite, mentioned
by Theocritus, of strewing <i>salt</i>. For Grilland asserts that,
in the festivals of the witches, salt was never presented.
Ibid., p. 215. It was perhaps excluded from their infernal
rites as having been so much used as a sacred symbol.]</p>

<p>The following are among the twenty-eight “singular
vertues” attributed by Butler to Honey: “… It breedeth
good blood, it prolongeth old age … yea the bodies of
the dead being embalmed with honey have been thereby preserved
from putrefaction. And <i>Athenæus</i> doth witness it
to be as effectual for the living, writing out of Lycus, that
the Cyrneans, or inhabitants of Corsica, were therefore long-lived,
because they did dailie vse to feed on honey, whereof
they had abundance: and no marvaile: seeing it is so soveraigne
a thing, and so many waies available for man’s
health, as well being outwardly as inwardly applied. It is
drunke against the bite of a serpent or mad dogs: and it
is good for them having eaten mushrooms, or drunke popy,
etc.”<a id="Marker_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="marker">716</a></p>

<p>In the Treasvrie of Avncient and Moderne Times,<a id="Marker_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="marker">717</a> there
are two chapters devoted to the “Vertues of Honey.”</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_209" title="209"></a><!--210.png-->

<p>There is a story, that a man once came to Mohammed,
and told him that his brother was afflicted with a violent
pain in his belly; upon which the prophet bade him give
him some honey. The fellow took his advice; but soon
after coming again, told him that the medicine had done his
brother no manner of service: Mohammed answered, “Go
and give him more honey, for God speaks truth, and thy
brother’s belly lies.” And the dose being repeated, the
man, by God’s mercy, was immediately cured.<a id="Marker_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="marker">718</a></p>

<p>In the sixteenth chapter of the Koran, Mohammed has
likewise mentioned honey as a medicine for men.<a id="Marker_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="marker">719</a></p>

<p>Athenæus tells us that Democritus, the philosopher of
Abdera, after he had determined to rid himself of life on
account of his extreme old age, and when he had begun to
diminish his food day by day, when the day of the Thesmophonian
festival came round, and the women of his household
besought him not to die during the festival, in order
that they might not be debarred from their share of the
festivities, was persuaded and ordered a vessel full of honey
to be set near him: and in this way he lived many days with
no other support than honey; and then some days after,
when the honey had been taken away, he died. But Democritus,
Athenæus adds, had always been fond of honey; and
he once answered a man, who had asked him how he could
live in the enjoyment of the best health, that he might do
so if he constantly moistened his inward parts with honey
and his outward man with oil. Bread and honey was the
chief food of the Pythagoreans, according to the statement
of Aristoxenus, who says that those who ate this for breakfast
were free from disease all their lives.<a id="Marker_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="marker">720</a></p>

<p>“The gall of a vulture,” says Moufet, quoting Galen, in
Euporist, “mingled with the juice of horehound (twice as
much in weight as the gall is) and two parts of honey cures
the suffusion of the eyes. Otherwise he mingles one part
of the gall of the sea-tortoise, and four times as much honey,
and anoints the eyes with it. Serenus prescribes such a receipt
to cause one to be quick-sighted:</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_210" title="210"></a><!--211.png-->


<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>

<p>We are told in the German Ephemerides, that a young
country girl, having eaten a great deal of honey, became so
inebriated with it, that she slept the whole day, and talked
foolishly the day following.<a id="Marker_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="marker">722</a></p>

<p>Bevan, in his work on the Honey-Bee, mentions the following
instances of a curious use to which propolis is sometimes
put by the Bees: A snail, says he, having crept into
one of Mr. Reaumur’s hives early in the morning, after
crawling about for some time, adhered, by means of its own
slime, to one of the glass panes. The Bees, having discovered
the snail, surrounded it, and formed a border of
propolis round the verge of its shell, and fastened it so
securely to the glass that it became immovable.</p>


<div class="poem">

<div class="line">Forever closed the impenetrable door;</div>

<div class="line">Year after year, life’s loitering spark remains.</div>
</div>
<div class="attribution i10"><span class="small-caps">Evans.</span></div>
</div>


<p>Maraldi, another eminent Apiarian, states that a snail
without a shell having entered one of his hives, the Bees, as
soon as they observed it, stung it to death; after which,
being unable to dislodge it, they covered it all over with an
impervious coat of propolis.</p>

<p>Xenophon tells us that all the soldiers, who ate of the
honey-combs, found in the villages on the mountains of the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_211" title="211"></a><!--212.png-->
Colchians, lost their senses, and were seized with such violent
vomiting and purging, that none of them were able to
stand upon their legs: that those who ate but little, were like
men very drunk, and those who ate much, like madmen, and
some like dying persons. In this condition, this writer adds,
great numbers lay upon the ground, as if there had been a
defeat, and a general sorrow prevailed. The next day, they
all recovered their senses, about the same hour they were
seized; and, on the third and fourth days, they got up as if
they had taken physic.<a id="Marker_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="marker">724</a></p>

<p>Pliny accounts for this accident by saying there is found
in that country a kind of honey, called from its effects, Thænomenon,
that is, that those who eat it are seized with madness.
He adds, that the common opinion is that this honey
is gathered from the flowers of a plant called <i>Rhododendros</i>,
which is very common in those parts. Tournefort thinks
the modern <i>Laurocerasus</i> is the Rhododendros of Pliny,
from the fact that the people of that country, at the present
day, believe the honey that is gathered from its flowers will
produce the effects described by Xenophon.<a id="Marker_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="marker">725</a></p>

<p>The missionary Moffat in South Africa found some poisonous
honey, which he unknowingly ate, but with no serious
consequences. It was several days, however, before he got
rid of a most unpleasant sensation in his head and throat.
The plant from which the honey had been gathered was an
Euphorbia.<a id="Marker_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="marker">726</a></p>

<p>“In Podolia,” says the chronicler Hollingshed, “which is
now subject to the King of Poland, their hives (of Bees)
and combes are so abundant, that huge bores, overturning
and falling into them, are drowned in the honie, before they
can recover &amp; find the meanes to come out.”<a id="Marker_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="marker">727</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_212" title="212"></a><!--213.png-->

<p>“To have a Bee in one’s bonnet” is a Scottish proverbial
phrase about equivalent to the English, “To have a maggot
in one’s head”&mdash;to be hair-brained. Kelly gives this with
an additional word: “There’s a Bee in your bonnet-<i>case</i>.”
In Scotland, too, it is said of a confused or stupefied man,
that his “head is in the Bees.”<a id="Marker_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="marker">730</a> These proverbial expressions
were also in vogue in England.<a id="Marker_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="marker">731</a></p>

<p>The following beautiful epigram, on a Bee inclosed in
amber, is from the pen of Martial: “The Bee is inclosed,
and shines preserved, in a tear of the sisters of Phaëton, so
that it seems enshrined in its own nectar. It has obtained
a worthy reward for its great toils; we may suppose that
the Bee itself would have desired such a death.</p>


<div class="poem">

<div class="line">The Bee inclosed, and through the amber shown,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The Septuagint has the following eulogium on the Bee in
Prov. vi. 8, which is not found in the Hebrew Scriptures: “Go
to the Bee, and learn how diligent she is, and what a noble
work she produces, whose labors kings and private men use
for their health; she is desired and honored by all, and
though weak in strength, yet since she values wisdom, she
prevails.”<a id="Marker_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="marker">733</a></p>

<p>In Spain Bees are in great estimation; and this is evinced

Bees, sheep, millstones, a pen behind the ear, and a place

<p>The following anecdote in the history of the Humble-bee
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_213" title="213"></a><!--214.png-->
(<i>Bombus</i>) is from the account of Josselyn of his voyages to
New England, printed in 1674: “Near upon twenty years
since there lived an old planter near <i>Blackpoint</i>, who on a
Sunshine day about one of the clock lying upon a green bank
not far from his house, charged his Son, a lad of 12 years of
age, to awaken him when he had slept two hours; the old
man falls asleep, and lying upon his back gaped with his
mouth wide open enough for a Hawke to &mdash;&mdash; into it; after
a little while the lad sitting by spied a Humble-bee creeping
out of his Father’s mouth, which taking wing flew quite out
of sight, the hour as the lad guest being come to awaken his
Father, he jagged him and called aloud Father, Father, it is
two o’clock, but all would not rouse him, at last he sees the
Humble-bee returning, who lighted upon the sleeper’s lip
and walked down as the lad conceived into his belly, and
presently he awaked.”<a id="Marker_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="marker">735</a></p>

<p>The following, on the different species of Humble-bees, is
one of the popular rhymes of Scotland:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The todler-tyke has a very gude byke,</div>

<p>When the Archbishop of St. Andrews was cruelly murdered
in 1679, “upon the opening of his tobacco box a living
humming bee flew out,” which was explained to be a familiar
or devil. A Scottish woman declared that a child was poisoned
by its grandmother, who, together with herself, were
“in the shape of bume-bees,” that the former carried the
poison “in her cleugh, wings, and mouth.” A great Bee
constantly resorted to another after receiving the Satanic
mark, and rested on it.<a id="Marker_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="marker">737</a></p>

<p>An anecdote is related by M. Reaumur respecting the
thimble-shaped nest, formed of leaves, of the Carpenter-bee
(<i>Apis centuncularis?</i>), which is a striking instance of the
ridiculous superstition which prevails among the uneducated,
and which even sometimes has no slight influence on
those of better understandings. “In the beginning of July,
1736, the learned Abbé Nollet, then at Paris, was surprised
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_214" title="214"></a><!--215.png-->
by a visit from an auditor of the chamber of accounts,
whose estate lay at a distant village on the borders of
the Seine, a few leagues from Rouen. This gentleman
came accompanied, among other domestics, by a gardener,
whose face had an air of much concern. He had come
to Paris in consequence of having found in his master’s
ground many rows of leaves, unaccountably disposed in
a mystical manner, and which he could not but believe
were there placed by witchcraft, for the secret destruction
of his lord and family. He had, after recovering
from his first consternation, shown them to the curate of the
parish, who was inclined to be of a similar opinion, and advised
him without delay to take a journey to Paris, and
make his lord acquainted with the circumstance. This gentleman,
though not quite so much alarmed as the honest
gardener, could not feel himself at perfect ease, and therefore
thought it advisable to consult his surgeon upon the
business, who, though a man eminent in his profession,
declared himself utterly unacquainted with the nature of
what was shown him, but took the liberty of advising that
the Abbé Nollet, as a philosopher, should be consulted,
whose well-known researches in natural knowledge might
perhaps enable him to elucidate the matter. It was in
consequence of this advice that the Abbé received the visit
above mentioned, and had the satisfaction of relieving all
parties from their embarrassment, by showing them several
nests formed on a similar plan by other insects, and assuring
them that those in their possession were the work of insects
also.”<a id="Marker_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="marker">738</a></p>

<p>In an English paper, the Observer, of July 25, 1813,
there is an account of a “swarm of Bees resting themselves
on the inside of a lady’s parasol.” They were hived without
any serious injury to the lady.</p>

<p>In the Annual Register, 1767, p. 117, there was published
by M. Lippi, Licentiate in Physic of the army of Paris, an
account of a petrified Beehive, discovered on the mountains
of Siout, in Upper Egypt. Broken open it disclosed the
larvæ of Bees in the cells, hard and solid, and Bees themselves
dried up like mummies. Honey was also found in
the cells!<a id="Marker_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="marker">739</a> The account is curious, but not entitled to much
credit.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_215" title="215"></a><!--216.png-->

<p>In the Liverpool Advertiser, and Times, of Nov. 24,
1817, there is a lengthy account of three Bees being found
in a state of animation in a huge solid rock from the Western
Point Quarry. Scientific attention was attracted, and
as appears from the above-mentioned papers of Dec. 5, 1817,
the mystery was cleared up by discovering in the rock “a
sand hole” through which the insects had made their way.<a id="Marker_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="marker">740</a></p>

<span class="subtitle">LEPIDOPTERA.</span></h2>


<h3 id="Papilionidae_Butterflies">Papilionidæ&mdash;Butterflies.</h3>

<p>The lepidopterous insects in general, soon after they
emerge from the pupa state, and commonly during their first
flight, discharge some drops of a red-colored fluid, more or
less intense in different species, which, in some instances,
where their numbers have been considerable, have produced
the appearance of a “shower of blood,” as this natural phenomenon
is commonly called.</p>

<p>Showers of blood have been recorded by historians and
poets as preternatural&mdash;have been considered in the light of
prodigies, and regarded where they have happened as fearful
prognostics of impending evils.</p>

<p>There are two passages in Homer, which, however poetical,
are applicable to a rain of this kind; and among the
prodigies which took place after the death of the great
dictator, Ovid particularly mentions a shower of blood:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Sæpe faces visæ mediis ardere sub astris,</div>
<div class="line">Sæpe inter nimbos guttæ cecidere cruentæ.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">With threatening signs the lowering skies were fill’d,</div>
<div class="line">And sanguine drops from murky clouds distilled.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among the numerous prodigies reported by Livy to have
happened in the year 214 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, it is instanced that, at Mantua,
a stagnating piece of water, caused by the overflowing
of the River Mincius, appeared as of blood; and, in the
cattle-market at Rome, a shower of blood fell in the Istrian
Street. After mentioning several other remarkable phenomena
that happened during that year, Livy concludes by
saying that these prodigies were expiated, conformably to
the answers of the Aruspices, by victims of the greater
kinds, and supplication was ordered to be performed to all
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_217" title="217"></a><!--218.png-->
the deities who had shrines at Rome.<a id="Marker_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="marker">741</a> Again it is stated
by Livy, that many alarming prodigies were seen at Rome
in the year 181 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and others reported from abroad;
among which was a shower of blood, which fell in the
courts of the temples of Vulcan and Concord. After
mentioning that the image of Juno Sospita shed tears,
and that a pestilence broke out in the country, this writer
adds, that these prodigies, and the mortality which prevailed,
alarmed the Senate so much, that they ordered the consuls
to sacrifice to such gods as their judgment should direct,
victims of the larger kinds, and that the Decemvirs should
consult their books. Pursuant to their direction, a supplication
for one day was proclaimed to be performed at every
shrine at Rome; and they advised, besides, and the Senate
voted, and the consul proclaimed, that there should be a
supplication and public worship for three days throughout
all Italy.<a id="Marker_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="marker">742</a> In the year 169 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, Livy also mentions that a
shower of blood fell in the middle of the day. The Decemvirs
were again called upon to consult their books, and again
were sacrifices offered to the deities.<a id="Marker_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="marker">743</a> The account, also, of
Livy, of the bloody sweat, on some of the statues of the
gods, must be referred to the same phenomenon; as the predilection
of those ages to marvel, says Thomas Brown, and
the want of accurate investigation in the cases recorded,
as well as the rare occurrence of these atmospherical depositions
in our own times, inclines us to include them among
the blood-red drops deposited by insects.<a id="Marker_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="marker">744</a></p>

<p>In Stow’s Annales of England, we have two accounts of
showers of blood; and from an edition printed in London
in 1592, we make our quotations: “Rivallus, sonne of
Cunedagius, succeeded his father, in whose time (in the year
766 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>) it rained bloud 3 dayes: after which tempest
ensued a great multitude of venemous flies, which slew much
people, and then a great mortalitie throughout this lande,
caused almost desolation of the same.”<a id="Marker_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="marker">745</a> The second
account is as follows: “In the time of Brithricus (<span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 786)
it rayned blood, which falling on men’s clothes, appeared
like crosses.”<a id="Marker_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="marker">746</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_218" title="218"></a><!--219.png-->

<p>Hollingshed, Graften, and Fabyan have also recorded
these instances in their respective chronicles of England.<a id="Marker_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="marker">747</a></p>

<p>A remarkable instance of bloody rain is introduced into
the very interesting Icelandic ghost story of Thorgunna.
It appears that in the year of our Lord 1009, a woman
called Thorgunna came from the Hebrides to Iceland, where
she stayed at the house of Thorodd: and during the hay
season, a shower of blood fell, but only, singularly, on that
portion of the hay she had not piled up as her share, which
so appalled her that she betook herself to her bed, and soon
afterward died. She left, to finish the story, a remarkable
will, which, from not being executed, was the cause of several
violent deaths, the appearance of ghosts, and, finally, a
legal action of ejectment against the ghosts, which, it need
hardly be said, drove them effectually away.<a id="Marker_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="marker">748</a></p>

<p>In 1017, a shower of blood fell in Aquitaine;<a id="Marker_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="marker">749</a> and Sleidan
relates that in the year 1553 a vast multitude of Butterflies
swarmed through a great part of Germany, and sprinkled
plants, leaves, buildings, clothes, and men with bloody drops,
as if it had rained blood.<a id="Marker_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="marker">750</a> We learn also from Bateman’s
Doome, that these “drops of bloude upon hearbes and trees,”
in 1553, were deemed among the forewarnings of the deaths
of Charles and Philip, dukes of Brunswick.<a id="Marker_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="marker">751</a></p>

<p>In Frankfort, in the year 1296, among other prodigies,
some spots of blood led to a massacre of the Jews, in which
ten thousand of these unhappy descendants of Abraham
lost their lives.<a id="Marker_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="marker">752</a></p>

<p>In the beginning of July, 1608, an extensive shower of
blood took place at Aix, in France, which threw the people
of that place into the utmost consternation, and, which is a
much more important fact, led to the first satisfactory and
philosophical explanation of this phenomenon, but too late,
alas! to save the Jews of Frankfort. This explanation was
given by M. Peiresc, a celebrated philosopher of that place,
and is thus referred to by his biographer, Gassendi: “Nothing
in the whole year 1608 did more please him than that
he observed and philosophized about, the <i>bloody rain</i>, which
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_219" title="219"></a><!--220.png-->
was commonly reported to have fallen about the beginning
of July; great drops thereof were plainly to be seen, both
in the city itself, upon the walls of the church-yard of the
church, which is near the city wall, and upon the city walls
themselves; also upon the walls of villages, hamlets, and
towns, for some miles round about; for in the first place, he
went himself to see those wherewith the stones were colored,
and did what he could to come to speak with those husbandmen,
who, beyond Lambesk, were reported to have been
affrighted at the falling of said rain, that they left their
work, and ran as fast as their legs could carry them into the
adjacent houses. Whereupon, he found that it was a fable
that was reported, touching those husbandmen. Nor was
he pleased that naturalists should refer this kind of rain to
vapours drawn up out of red earth aloft in the air, which
congealing afterwards into liquor, fall down in this form;
because such vapours as are drawne aloft by heat, ascend
without color, as we may know by the alone example of red
roses, out of which the vapours that arise by heat are congealed
into transparent water. He was less pleased with
the common people, and some divines, who judged that it was
the work of the devils and witches who had killed innocent
young children; for this he counted a mere conjecture, possibly
also injurious to the goodness and providence of God.</p>

<p>“In the mean while an accident happened, out of which he
conceived he had collected the true cause thereof. For, some
months before, he shut up in a box a certain palmer-worm
which he had found, rare for its bigness and form; which, when
he had forgotten, he heard a buzzing in the box, and when he
opened it, found the palmer-worm, having cast its coat, to
be turned into a beautiful Butterfly, which presently flew
away, leaving in the bottom of the box a red drop as broad
as an ordinary sous or shilling; and because this happened
about the beginning of the same month, and about the same
time an incredible multitude of Butterflies were observed
flying in the air, he was therefore of opinion that such kind
of Butterflies resting on the walls had there shed such like
drops, and of the same bigness. Whereupon, he went the
second time, and found, by experience, that those drops
were not to be found on the house-tops, nor upon the round
sides of the stones which stuck out, as it would have happened,
if blood had fallen from the sky, but rather where
the stones were somewhat hollowed, and in holes, where
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_220" title="220"></a><!--221.png-->
such small creatures might shroud and nestle themselves.
Moreover, the walls which were so spotted, were not in the
middle of towns, but they were such as bordered upon the
fields, nor were they on the highest parts, but only so
moderately high as Butterflies are commonly wont to fly.</p>

<p>“Thus, therefore, he interpreted that which Gregory of
Tours relates, touching a bloody rain seen at Paris in divers
places, in the days of Childebert, and on a certain house in
the territory of Seulis; also that which is storied, touching
raining of blood about the end of June, in the days of King
Robert; so that the blood which fell upon flesh, garments,
or stones could not be washed out, but that which fell on
wood might; for it was the same season of Butterflies, and
experience hath taught us, that no water will wash these
spots out of the stones, while they are fresh and new. When
he had said these and such like things to various, a great
company of auditors being present, it was agreed that they
should go together and search out the matter, and as they
went up and down, here and there, through the fields, they
found many drops upon stones and rocks; but they were
only on the hollow and under parts of the stones, but not
upon those which lay most open to the skies.”<a id="Marker_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="marker">753</a></p>

<p>This memorable shower of blood was produced by the
<i>Vanessa urticæ</i>, or <i>V. polychloros</i>, most probably, since
these species of Butterflies are said to have been uncommonly
plentiful at the time when, and in the particular district
where, the phenomenon was observed.<a id="Marker_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="marker">754</a><a id="Marker_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="marker">755</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_221" title="221"></a><!--222.png-->

<p>Nicoll, in his Diary, p. 8, informs us that on the 28th of
May, 1650, “there rained blood the space of three miles in
the Earl of Buccleuch’s bounds (Scotland), near the English
border, which was verefied in presence of the Committee of
State.”<a id="Marker_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="marker">756</a></p>

<p>We learn from Fountainhall that on Sunday, May 1st,
1687, a young woman of noted piety, Janet Fraser by name,
the daughter of a weaver in the parish of Closeburn, Dumfriesshire,
went out to the fields with a young female companion,
and sat down to read the Bible not far from her
father’s house. Feeling thirsty, she went to the river-side
(the Nith) to get a drink, leaving her Bible open at the
place where she had been reading, which presented the
verses of the 34th chapter of Isaiah, beginning&mdash;“My sword
shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon
Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment,”
etc. On returning, she found a patch of something like
blood covering this very text. In great surprise, she carried
the book home, where a young man tasted the substance
with his tongue, and found it of a saltless or insipid flavor.
On the two succeeding Sundays, while the same girl was
reading the Bible in the open air, similar blotches of matter,
like blood, fell upon the leaves. She did not perceive it in
the act of falling till it was about an inch from the book.
“It is not blood,” our informant adds, “for it is as tough as
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_222" title="222"></a><!--223.png-->
glue, and will not be scraped off by a knife, as blood will;
but it is so like blood, as none can discern any difference by
the colour.”<a id="Marker_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="marker">757</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday, Oct. 9th, 1764, “a kind of rain of a red
color, resembling blood, fell in many parts of the Duchy of
Cleves, which caused great consternation. M. Bouman sent
a bottle of it to Dr. Schutte, to know if it contained anything
pernicious to health. Something of the like kind fell
also at Rhenen, in the Province of Utrecht.”<a id="Marker_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="marker">758</a></p>

<p>Dr. Schutte, to whom was submitted a bottle of this red
rain, gave it as his opinion that it was caused by particles
of red matter, which had been raised into the atmosphere by
a strong wind, and that it was in no way hurtful to mankind
or beasts!<a id="Marker_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="marker">759</a></p>

<p>In 1819, a red shower fell in Carniola, which, being
analyzed, says Bucke, was found to be impregnated with
silex, alumine, and oxide of iron. Red rain fell also at
Dixmude, in Flanders, November 2d, 1829; and on the following
day at Schenevingen, the acid obtained from which
was chloric acid, and the metal cobalt.<a id="Marker_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="marker">760</a></p>

<p>In the year 1780, Rombeag noticed a shower of blood
that had excited universal attention, and which he could
satisfactorily show to be produced by the flying forth and
casting of bees, as the phenomenon in the place around the
beehives themselves was remarkably striking. From this
fact it is evident that the appearance is attributable to other
insects as well as the lepidoptera.<a id="Marker_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="marker">761</a></p>

<p>Bloody rain has also been attributed, with much apparent
reason, to other causes still, as the following accounts from
reliable authorities show:</p>

<p>In 1848, Dr. Eckhard, of Berlin, when attending a case of
cholera, found potatoes and bread within the house spotted
with a red coloring matter, which, being forwarded to Ehrenberg,
was found by him to be due to the presence of an
animalcule, to which he gave the name of the <i>Monas prodigiosa</i>.
It was found that other pieces of bread could be
inoculated with this matter.<a id="Marker_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="marker">762</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_223" title="223"></a><!--224.png-->

<p>Swammerdam relates that, one morning in 1670, great
excitement was created in the Hague by a report that the
lakes and ditches about Leyden were turned to blood.
Florence Schuyl, the celebrated professor of physic in the
University of Leyden, went down to the canals, and taking
home a quantity of this blood-colored matter examined it
with a microscope, and found that the water was water still,
and had not at all changed its color; but that it was full of
small red animals, all alive and very nimble in their motions,
the color and prodigious numbers of which gave a reddish
tinge to the whole body of the water in which they lived.
The animals which thus color the water of lakes and ponds
are the <i>Pulices arborescentes</i> of Swammerdam, or the
water fleas with branched horns. These creatures are of a
reddish yellow or flame color. They live about the sides of
ditches, under weeds, and among the mud; and are therefore
the less visible, except at a certain time, which is in the
month of June. It is at this time these little animals leave
their recesses to float about the water, and meet for the
propagation of their species; and by this means they become
visible in the color which they give to the water. The
color in question is visible, more or less, in one part or
other of almost all standing waters at this season; and it is
always at the same season that the bloody waters have
alarmed the ignorant.<a id="Marker_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="marker">763</a></p>

<p>The prodigy, mentioned by Livy, of a stagnating piece
of water at Mantua appearing as of blood, was no doubt
owing to the appearance of great numbers of the <i>Pulices
arborescentes</i> in it.<a id="Marker_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="marker">764</a></p>

<p>Concerning the origin of bloody rain, Swammerdam entertained
the same idea as Peiresc; but he does not appear
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_224" title="224"></a><!--225.png-->
to have verified it from his own observation. He makes
the following remarks: “Is it not possible that such red
drops might issue from insects, at the time they come fresh
from the nymphs, which distil a bloody fluid? This seems
to happen especially when such insects are more than ordinarily
multiplied in any particular year, as we often experience
in the butterflies, flies, gnats, and others.”<a id="Marker_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="marker">765</a></p>

<p>Dust is commonly attributed as the cause of this phenomenon,
but will satisfactorily explain only a few instances.
A writer for Chambers’ Journal, in an article on showers of
red dust, bloody rain, etc., says: “In October, 1846, a fearful
and furious hurricane visited Lyon, and the district between
that city and Grenoble, during which occurred a fall
of blood-rain. A number of drops were caught and preserved,
and when the moisture was evaporated, there was
seen the same kind of dust (as fell in showers in Genoa in
1846) of a yellowish brown or red color. When placed
under the microscope, it exhibited a great proportion of
fresh water and marine formations. Phytolytharia were
numerous, as also ‘neatly-lobed vegetable scales;’ which, as
Ehrenberg observes, is sufficient to disprove the assertion
that the substance is found in the atmosphere itself, and is
not of European origin. For the first time, a living organism
was met with, the ‘<i>Eunota amphyoxis</i>, with its ovaries
green, and therefore capable of life.’ Here was a solution
of the mystery: the dust, mingling with the drops of water
falling from the clouds, produced the red rain. Its appearance
is that of reddened water, and it cannot be called
blood-like without exaggeration.”<a id="Marker_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="marker">766</a></p>

<p>To conclude the history of bloody rain, the following is
most appropriate: In 1841, some negroes, in Wilson County,
Tennessee, reported that it had rained blood in the tobacco
field where they had been at work; that near noon there
was a rattling noise like rain or hail, and drops of blood,
as they supposed, fell from a red cloud that was flying over.
Prof. Troost, of Nashville, was called upon to explain the
phenomenon; and, after citing many instances of red rain,
red snow, and so called showers of blood, he concluded his
learned article with this opinion: “A wind might have
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_225" title="225"></a><!--226.png-->
taken up part of an animal, which was in a state of decomposition,
and have brought it in contact with an electric
cloud, in which it was kept in a state of partial fluidity or
viscosity. In this case, the cloud which was seen by the negroes,
as the state in which the materials were, is accounted
for.”</p>

<p>Prof. Troost published this profound solution in the forty-first
volume of Silliman’s Journal; but in the forty-fourth
of the same magazine a much more satisfactory one is given,
for it is there stated “that the whole affair was a hoax devised
by the negroes, who pretended to have seen the shower
for the sake of practicing on the credulity of their masters.
They had scattered the decaying flesh of a dead hog over
the tobacco leaves.”<a id="Marker_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="marker">767</a></p>

<p>Another phenomenon to be particularly noticed in the
history of the Butterflies, is their appearance at certain
times in countless numbers migrating from place to place.
H. Kapp, a writer in the <i>Naturforsch</i>, observed on a calm
sunny day a prodigious flight of the Cabbage-Butterfly,
<i>Pontia brassicæ</i>, which passed from northeast to southwest,
and lasted two hours.<a id="Marker_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="marker">768</a> Kalm, the Swedish traveler,
saw these last insects midway in the British Channel.<a id="Marker_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="marker">769</a>
Lindley tells us that in Brazil, in the beginning of March,
1803, for many days successively there was an immense
flight of white and yellow Butterflies, probably of the same
tribe as the <i>Pontia brassicæ</i>. They were observed never to
settle, but proceeded in a direction from northwest to southeast.
No buildings seemed to stop them from steadily pursuing
their course; which being to the ocean, at only a
small distance, they must all have inevitably perished. It is
to be remarked that at this time no other kind of Butterfly
was to be seen, though the country usually abounds in such
a variety.<a id="Marker_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="marker">770</a></p>

<p>A somewhat similar migration of Butterflies was observed
in Switzerland on the 8th or 10th of June, 1828.
The facts are as follows: Madame de Meuron Wolff and
her family, established during the summer in the district of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_226" title="226"></a><!--227.png-->
Grandson, Canton de Vaud, perceived with surprise an immense
flight of Butterflies traversing the garden with great
rapidity. They were all of the species called <i>Belle Dame</i>
by the French, and by the English the Painted Lady (<i>Vanessa
cardui</i>, Stephens). They were all flying close together
in the same direction, from south to north, and were
so little afraid when any one approached, that they turned
not to the right or to the left. The flight continued for
two hours without interruption, and the column was about
ten or fifteen feet broad. They did not stop to alight on
flowers; but flew onward, low and equally. This fact is
the more singular, when it is considered that the larvæ of the
<i>Vanessa cardui</i> are not gregarious, but are solitary from
the moment they are hatched; nor are the Butterflies themselves
usually found together in numbers. Professor Bonelli,
of Turin, however, observed a similar flight of the
same species of Butterflies in the end of March preceding
their appearance at Grandson, when it may be presumed
they had just emerged from the pupa state. Their flight,
as at Grandson, was from south to north, and their numbers
were so immense, that at night the flowers were literally
covered with them. As the spring advanced, their numbers
diminished; but even in June a few still continued. A similar
flight of Butterflies is recorded about the end of the
last century by M. Loche, in the Memoirs of the Turin
Academy. During the whole season, these Butterflies, as
well as their larvæ, were very abundant, and more beautiful
than usual.<a id="Marker_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="marker">771</a></p>

<p>Pallas once saw such vast flights of the orange-tipped Butterfly,
<i>Pontia cardamines</i>, in the vicinity of Winofka, that
he at first mistook them for flakes of snow.<a id="Marker_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="marker">772</a> At Barbados,
some days previous to the hurricane in 1780, the trees and
shrubs were entirely covered with a species of Butterfly of
the most beautiful colors, so as to screen from the sight the
branches, and even the trunks of the trees. In the afternoon
before the gale came on, and when it was quite still,
they all suddenly disappeared. The gale came on soon
after.<a id="Marker_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="marker">773</a> Darwin tells us that several times, when the “Beagle”
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_227" title="227"></a><!--228.png-->
had been some miles off the mouth of the Plata, and at other
times when off the shores of Northern Patagonia, the air
was filled with insects: that one evening, when the ship was
about ten miles from the Bay of San Blas, vast numbers of
Butterflies, in bands or flocks of countless myriads, extended
as far as the eye could range. The seamen cried out “It
was raining Butterflies,” and such in fact, continues Darwin,
was the appearance. Several species were in this flock, but
they were chiefly of a kind very similar to, but not identical
with, the common English <i>Colias edusa</i>. Some moths and
hymenopterous insects accompanied the Butterflies; and a
fine beetle (<i>Calosoma</i>) flew on board.<a id="Marker_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="marker">774</a> Captain Adams
mentions an extraordinary flight of small Butterflies, with
spotted wings, which took place at Annamaboo, on the
Guinea coast, after a tornado. The wind veered to the
northward, and blew fresh from the land, with thick mist,
which brought off from the shore so many of these insects,
that for one hour the atmosphere was so filled with them as
to represent a snow-storm driving past the vessel at a rapid
rate, which was lying at anchor about two miles from the
shore.<a id="Marker_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="marker">775</a></p>

<p>Mr. Charles J. Anderson encountered, in South-western
Africa, for two consecutive days, such immense myriads of
lemon-colored Butterflies that the sound caused by their
wings was such as to resemble “the distant murmuring of
waves on the sea-shore.” They always passed in the same
direction as the wind blew, and, as numbers were constantly
alighting on the flowers, their appearance at such times was
not unlike “the falling of leaves before a gentle autumnal
breeze.”<a id="Marker_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="marker">776</a></p>

<p>In Bermuda, October 10, 1847, the Butterfly, <i>Terias lisa</i>
of Boisduval, suddenly appeared in great abundance, hundreds
being seen in every direction. Previous to that occasion,
Mr. Hurdis, the observer of this flight, had never met
with this Butterfly. In the course of a few days, they had
all disappeared.<a id="Marker_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="marker">777</a></p>

<p>In Ceylon, in the months of April and May, migrations
of Butterflies (mostly the <i>Callidryas hilariæ</i>, <i>C. alcmeone</i>,
and <i>C. pyranthe</i>, with straggling individuals of the genus
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_228" title="228"></a><!--229.png-->
<i>Euplœa</i>, <i>E. coras</i>, and <i>E. prothoe</i>) are quite frequent.
Their passage is generally in a northeasterly direction. The
flights of these delicate insects appear to the eye of a white
or pale yellow hue, and apparently to extend miles in
breadth, and of such prodigious length as to occupy hours,
and even days, in their uninterrupted passage. A friend of
Tennent, traveling from Kandy to Kornegalle, drove for
<i>nine miles</i> through such a cloud of white Butterflies, which
was passing <i>across</i> the road by which he went. Whence
these immense numbers of Butterflies come no one knows,
and whither going no one can tell. But the natives have a
superstitious belief that their flight is ultimately directed to
Adam’s Peak, and that their pilgrimage ends on reaching
that sacred mountain.<a id="Marker_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="marker">778</a></p>

<p>Moufet says: “Wert thou as strong as Milo or Hercules,
and wert fenced or guarded about with an host of giants for
force and valour, remember that such an army was put to
the worst by an army of Butterflies flying in troops in the
air, in the year 1104, and they hid the light of the sun like
a cloud. Licosthenes relates, that on the third day of August,
1543, that no hearb was left by reason of their multitudes,
and they had devoured all the sweet dew and natural
moisture, and they had burned up the very grasse that was
consumed with their dry dung.”<a id="Marker_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="marker">779</a></p>

<p>The most beautiful as well as pleasing emblem among the
Egyptians was exhibited under the character of Psyche&mdash;the
Soul. This was originally no other than a Butterfly:
but it afterwards was represented as a lovely female child
with the beautiful wings of that insect. The Butterfly, after
its first and second stages as an egg and larva, lies for a
season in a manner dead; and is inclosed in a sort of coffin.
In this state it remains a shorter or longer period; but at
last bursting its bonds, it comes out with new life, and in
the most beautiful attire. The Egyptians thought this a
very proper picture of the soul of man, and of the immortality,
to which it aspired. But they made it more particularly
an emblem of Osiris; who having been confined in an
oak or coffin, and in a state of death, at last quitted his
prison, and enjoyed a renewal of life.<a id="Marker_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="marker">780</a> This symbol passed
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_229" title="229"></a><!--230.png-->
over to the Greeks and Romans, who also considered the
Butterfly as the symbol of Zephyr.<a id="Marker_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="marker">781</a></p>

<p>Among the coats of arms of several of our most celebrated
tribes of Indians, Baron Lahontan mentions one, that
of the “Illinese,” which bore a beech-leaf with a Butterfly
argent.<a id="Marker_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="marker">782</a></p>

<p>The sight of a trio of Butterflies is considered an omen
of death.<a id="Marker_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="marker">783</a> An English superstition.</p>

<p>If a Butterfly enters a house, a death is sure to follow
shortly in the family occupying it; if it enters through the
window, the death will be that of an infant or very young
person. As far as I know this superstition is peculiar to
Maryland.</p>

<p>If a Butterfly alights upon your head, it foretells good
news from a distance. This superstition obtains in Pennsylvania
and Maryland.</p>

<p>The first Butterfly seen in the summer brings good luck
to him who catches it. This notion prevails in New York.</p>

<p>In Western Pennsylvania, it is believed that if the chrysalides
of Butterflies be found suspended mostly on the under
sides of rails, limbs, etc., as it were to protect them from
rain, that there will soon be much rain, or, as it is termed, a
“rainy spell”; but, on the contrary, if they are found on
twigs and slender branches, that the weather will be dry and
clear.</p>

<p>Du Halde and Grosier tell us that the Butterflies of the
mountain of Lo-few-shan, in the province of Quang-tong,
China, are so much esteemed for their size and beauty, that
they are sent to court, where they become a part of certain
ornaments in the palaces. The wings of these Butterflies
are very large, and their colors surprisingly diversified and
lively.<a id="Marker_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="marker">784</a> Dionysius Kao, a native of China, also remarks, in
his Geographical Description of that Empire, that the Butterflies
of Quang-tong are generally sent to the emperor, as
they form a part of the furniture of the imperial cabinets.<a id="Marker_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="marker">785</a></p>

<p>Osbeck says the Chinese put up insects in boxes made
of coarse wood, without covering, and lined with paper,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_230" title="230"></a><!--231.png-->
which they carry round to sell; each box bringing half a
piastre. Of the Butterflies, which were the principal insects
thus sold, he enumerates twenty-one species.<a id="Marker_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="marker">786</a></p>

<p>The Chinese children make Butterflies of paper, with
which “they play after night by sending them, like kites,
into the air.”<a id="Marker_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="marker">787</a></p>

<p>We learn from Captain Stedman, that even in the forests
of Guiana, some people make Butterfly-catching their business,
and obtain much money by it. They collect and
arrange them in paper boxes, and send them off to the different
cabinets of Europe.<a id="Marker_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="marker">788</a></p>

<p>Butterflies are now extensively worn by French and
American ladies on their head-dresses.</p>

<p>From the relations of Sir Anthony Shirley, quoted in
Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy,<a id="Marker_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="marker">789</a> we learn that the kings
of Persia were wont to hawk after Butterflies with sparrows
and stares, or starlings, trained for the purpose; and we
are also told that M. de Luisnes (afterward Prime Minister
of France), in the nonage of Louis XIII., gained much
upon him by making hawks catch little birds, and by making
some of those little birds again catch Butterflies.<a id="Marker_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="marker">790</a></p>

<p>In the Zoological Journal, No. 13, it is recorded that at
a meeting of the Linnæan Society, March 11, 1832, Mr.
Stevens exhibited a remarkable freak of nature in a specimen
of <i>Vanessa urtica</i>, which possessed five wings, the
additional one being formed by a second, but smaller,
hinder wing on one side.<a id="Marker_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="marker">791</a></p>

<p>J.&nbsp;A. de Mandelsloe, who made a voyage to the East
Indies in 1639, tells us that not far from the Fort of Ternate
grows a certain shrub, called by the Indians <i>Catopa</i>,
from which falls a leaf, which, by degrees, is supposed to be
metamorphosed into a Butterfly.<a id="Marker_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="marker">792</a></p>

<p>De Pauw tells us that, not long before his time, the
French peasants entertained a kind of worship for the chrysalis
of the caterpillar found on the great nettle (the pupa
of <i>Vanessa cardui?</i>), because they fancied that it revealed
evident traces of Divinity; and quotes M. Des Landes in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_231" title="231"></a><!--232.png-->
saying that the curates had even ornamented the altars
with these pupæ.<a id="Marker_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="marker">793</a></p>

<p>The Butterfly (Ang. Sax. <i>Buttor-fleoge</i>, or <i>Buter-flege</i>) is
so named from the common yellow species, or from its appearing
in the butter season. Its German names are <i>Schmetterling</i>,
from <i>schmetten</i>, cream; and <i>Molkendieb</i>, the Whey-thief.
The association with milk in its three forms, in butter,
cream, and whey, is remarkable.</p>

<p>The African Bushmen eat the caterpillars of Butterflies;
and the Natives of New Holland eat the caterpillars of a
species of Moth, and also a kind of Butterfly, which they
call <i>Bugong</i>, which congregates in certain districts, at particular
seasons, in countless myriads. On these occasions
the native blacks assemble from far and near to collect them;
and after removing the wings and down by stirring them on
the ground, previously heated by a large fire, winnowing
them, eat the bodies, or store them up for use, by pounding
and smoking them. The bodies of these Butterflies abound
in oil, and taste like nuts. When first eaten, they produce
violent vomitings and other debilitating effects; but these
go off after a few days, and the natives then thrive and
fatten exceedingly on this diet, for which they have to contend
with a black crow, which is also attracted by the Butterflies,
and which they dispatch with their clubs and use also
as food.</p>

<p>Another practice in Australia is to follow up the flight of
the Butterflies, and to light fires at nightfall beneath the
trees in which they have settled. The smoke brings the
insects down, when their bodies are collected and pounded
together into a sort of fleshy loaf.<a id="Marker_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="marker">794</a></p>

<p>Bennet tells us the larva of a Lepidopterous insect (the
<i>Bugong?</i>) that destroys the green-wattle (<i>Acacia decurrens</i>)
is much sought after, and considered a delicacy, by
the blacks of Australia. These people eat also the pink
grubs found in the wattle-trees, either roasted or uncooked.
Europeans, who have tasted of this dish, say it is not disagreeable.<a id="Marker_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="marker">795</a></p>

<p>Swammerdam, treating of the metamorphoses of larvæ
into pupæ and thence into perfect insects, makes the following
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_232" title="232"></a><!--233.png-->
curious comparison: “The worms, after the manner of the
brides in Holland, shut themselves up for a time, as it were
to prepare, and render themselves more amiable, when they
are to meet the other sex in the field of Hymen.”<a id="Marker_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="marker">796</a></p>


<h3 id="Sphingidae_Hawk-moths">Sphingidæ&mdash;Hawk-moths.</h3>

<p>To the superstitious imaginations of the Europeans, the
conspicuous markings on the back of a large evening moth,
the <i>Sphinx Atropos</i>, represent the human skull, with the
thigh-bones crossed beneath; hence is it called the <i>Death’s-head
Moth</i>, the <i>Death’s-head Phantom</i>, the <i>Wandering
Death-bird</i>, etc. Its cry,<a id="Marker_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="marker">797</a> which closely resembles the noise
caused by the creaking of cork, or the plaintive squeaking
of a mouse, certainly more than enough to frighten the
ignorant and superstitious, is considered the voice of anguish,
the moaning of a child, the signal of grief; and it is regarded
“not as the creation of a benevolent being, but as the device
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_233" title="233"></a><!--234.png-->
of evil spirits”&mdash;spirits, enemies to man, conceived and
fabricated in the dark; and the very shining of its eyes is
supposed to represent the fiery element whence it is thought
to have proceeded. Flying into their apartments in the
evening, it at times extinguishes the light, foretelling war,
pestilence, famine, and death to man. The sudden appearance
of these insects, we are informed by Latrielle, during
a season while the people were suffering from an epidemic
disease, tended much to confirm the notions of the superstitious
in that district, and the disease was attributed by them
entirely to their visitation.<a id="Marker_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="marker">798</a> Jaeger says, at a very recent
day, that this large Moth first attracted his “attention during
the prevalence of a severe and fatal epidemic, and of course
nothing more was necessary than its appearance at such a
time to induce an ignorant people to believe it the veritable
prophet and forerunner of death. A curate in Bretagne,
France,” continues this author, “made a most horrible and
fear-exciting description of this animal, describing the very
loud and dreadful sound which it emitted as a sort of lamentation
for the awful calamity which was coming on the
earth.”<a id="Marker_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="marker">799</a> Reaumur informs us that all the members of a
female convent in France were thrown into the greatest
consternation at the appearance of one of these insects, which
happened to fly in during the evening at one of the windows
of the dormitory.<a id="Marker_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="marker">800</a></p>

<p>In the Isle of France, the natives believe that the dust
(scales) cast from the wings of the Death’s-head Moth, in
flying through an apartment, is productive of blindness to
the visual organs on which it falls.<a id="Marker_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="marker">801</a></p>

<p>There is a quaint superstition in England that the Death’s-head
Moth has been very common in Whitehall ever since
the martyrdom of Charles I.<a id="Marker_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="marker">802</a></p>

<p>Illustrative of the tough texture of the skin with which
many soft larvæ are provided for protection, the following
may be instanced: Bonnet squeezed under water the caterpillar
of the privet Hawk-moth, <i>Sphinx ligustris</i>, till it
was as flat and empty as the finger of a glove, yet within an
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_234" title="234"></a><!--235.png-->
hour it became plump and lively as if nothing had happened.<a id="Marker_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="marker">803</a></p>

<p>The name Sphinx is applied to this genus of insects from
a fancied resemblance between the attitude assumed by the
larvæ of several of the larger species, when disturbed, and
that of the Egyptian Sphinx.</p>


<h3 id="Bombicidae_Silk-worm_Moths">Bombicidæ&mdash;Silk-worm Moths.</h3>

<p>The notices of the cultivation of the mulberry and the
rearing of Silk-worms, found in Chinese works, have been
industriously collected and published by M. Julien, by order
of the French government. From his work it appears
that credible notices of the culture of the tree and the manufacture
of silk are found as far back as <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> 780; and in
referring its invention to the Empress Siling, or Yuenfi,
wife of the Emperor Hwangti, <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> 2602 (Du Halde says
2698), the Chinese have shown their belief of its still higher
antiquity. The Shi King contains this distich:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The legitimate wife of Hwangti, named Siling Shi, began to rear Silk-worms:</div>
<div class="line">At this period Hwangti invented the art of making clothing.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Du Halde says this invention raised the Empress to the
rank of a divinity, under the title of Spirit of the Silk-worm,
and of the Mulberry-tree.<a id="Marker_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="marker">804</a></p>

<p>The Book of Rites contains a notice of the festival held
in honor of this art, which corresponds to that of plowing by
the emperor. “In the last month of spring, the young empress
purified herself and offered sacrifice to the goddess of
Silk-worms. She went into the eastern fields and collected
mulberry-leaves. She forbade noble dames and the ladies
of statesmen adorning themselves, and excused her attendants
from their sewing and embroidery, in order that they
might give all their care to the rearing of Silk-worms.”<a id="Marker_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="marker">805</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_235" title="235"></a><!--236.png-->

<p>The manufacture of silk has been known in India from
time immemorial, it being mentioned in the oldest Sanscrit
books.<a id="Marker_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="marker">806</a> It is the opinion of modern writers, however, that
the culture of the Silk-worm passed from China into India,
thence through Persia, and then, after the lapse of several
centuries, into Europe. But long before this, wrought silk
had been introduced into Greece from Persia. This was
effected by the army of Alexander the Great, about the
year 323 before Christ.</p>

<p>The Greeks fabled silk to have first been woven in the
Island of Cos by Pamphila, the daughter of Plateos.<a id="Marker_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="marker">807</a> Of
its true origin they were, in a great measure, ignorant, but
seem to have been positive that it was the work of an insect.
Pausanias thus describes the animal and its culture:
“But the thread, from which the Ceres (an Ethiopian race)
make garments, is not produced from a tree, but is procured
by the following method: A worm is found in their country
which the Greeks call <i>Seer</i>, but the Ceres themselves, by a different
name. This worm is twice as large as a beetle, and, in
other respects, resembles spiders which weave under trees.
It has, likewise, eight feet as well as the spider. The
Ceres rear these insects in houses adapted for this purpose
both to summer and winter. What these insects produce
is a slender thread, which is rolled round their feet. They
feed them for four years on oatmeal; and on the fifth (for
they do not live beyond five years) they give them a green
reed to feed on: for this is the sweetest of all food to this
insect. It feeds, therefore, on this till it bursts through
fullness, and dies: after which, they draw from its bowels
a great quantity of thread.”<a id="Marker_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="marker">808</a></p>

<p>Aristotle seems to have had a much clearer idea of the
origin of silk, for he says it was unwound from the <i>pupa</i>
(he does not expressly say the <i>pupa</i>, but this we must
suppose) of a large horned caterpillar.<a id="Marker_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="marker">809</a> The <i>larva</i> he means
could not, however, be the common Silk-worm, since it is
rather small and without horns.</p>

<p>Pliny, who, most probably, obtained the most of his ideas
from Pausanias and Aristotle, was of opinion that silk was
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_236" title="236"></a><!--237.png-->
the produce of a worm which built clay-nests and collected
wax. At first these worms, he says, assume the appearance
of small butterflies with naked bodies, but soon after,
being unable to endure the cold, they throw out bristly
hairs, which assume quite a thick coat against the winter,
by rubbing off the down that covers the leaves, by the aid
of the roughness of their feet. This they compress into
balls by carding it with their claws, and then draw it out
and hang it between the branches of the trees, making it
fine by combing it out, as it were: last of all, they take and
roll it round their body, thus forming a nest in which they
are enveloped. It is in this state that they are taken; after
which they are placed in earthen vessels in a warm place,
and fed upon bran. A peculiar sort of down soon shoots
forth upon the body, on being clothed with which they are
sent to work upon another task.<a id="Marker_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="marker">810</a></p>

<p>The first kinds of silk dresses worn by the Roman ladies
were from the Island of Cos, and, as Pliny says, were known
by the name of <i>Coæ vestes</i>.<a id="Marker_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="marker">811</a> These dresses, of which Pliny
says in such high praise, “that while they cover a woman,
they at the same time reveal her charms,” were indeed so
fine as to be transparent, and were sometimes dyed purple,
and enriched with stripes of gold. They had their name
from the early reputation which Cos acquired by its manufacture
of silk. But silk was a very scarce article among
the Romans for many ages, and so highly prized as to be
valued at its weight in gold. Vospicius informs us that
the Emperor Aurelian, who died <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 125, refused his empress
a robe of silk, which she earnestly solicited, merely on
account of its dearness. Galen, who lived about <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 173,
speaks of the rarity of silk, being nowhere then but at Rome,
and there only among the rich. Heliogabalus is said to
have been the first Roman that wore a garment entirely of
silk.</p>

<p>We learn from Tacitus, that early in the reign of Tiberius,
about <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 17, the Senate enacted “that men should not
defile themselves by wearing garments of silk.”<a id="Marker_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="marker">812</a> Pliny says,
however, that in his time men had become so degenerate as
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_237" title="237"></a><!--238.png-->
to not even feel ashamed to wear garments of this material.<a id="Marker_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="marker">813</a></p>

<p>The mode of producing and manufacturing silk was not
known to Europe until long after the Christian era, being
first learned about the year 555 by two Persian monks, who,
under the encouragement of the Emperor Justinian, procured
in India the eggs of the Silk-worm Moth, with which,
concealing them in hollow canes, they hastened to Constantinople.
They also brought with them instructions for
hatching the eggs, rearing and feeding the worms, and
drawing, spinning, and working the silk.<a id="Marker_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="marker">814</a></p>

<p>From Constantinople, the culture of the Silk-worm spread
over Greece, so that in less than five centuries that portion
of this country, hitherto called the Peloponnesus, changed
its denomination into that of Morea, from the immense
plantations of the <i>Morus alba</i>, or white mulberry.<a id="Marker_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="marker">815</a> Large
manufactories were set up at Athens, Thebes, and Corinth.
The Venetians, soon after this, commencing a commerce
with the Grecians, supplied all the western parts of Europe
with silks for many centuries. Several kinds of modern
silk manufactures, such as damasks, velvets, satins, etc.,
were as yet unknown.</p>

<p>About the year 1130, Roger II., King of Sicily, having
conquered the Peloponnesus, transported the Silk-worms
and such as cultivated them to Palermo and to Calabria.
Such was the success of the speculation in Calabria, that it
is doubtful whether, even at the present moment, it does not
produce more silk than the whole of the rest of Italy.<a id="Marker_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="marker">816</a></p>

<p>By degrees the rest of Italy, as well as Spain, learned
from the Sicilians and Calabrians the management of Silk-worms
and the working of silk; and at length, during the
wars of Charles VIII., in 1499, the French acquired it, by
right of neighborhood, and soon large plantations of the
mulberry were raised in Provence. Henry I. is reported
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_238" title="238"></a><!--239.png-->
to have been the first French king who wore silk stockings.
The invention, however, originally came from Spain,
whence silk stockings were brought over to England to
Henry VIII. and Edward VI.</p>

<p>It is stated, that at the celebration of the marriage between
Margaret, daughter of Henry III., and Alexander III. of
Scotland, in the year 1251, a most extravagant display of
magnificence was made by one thousand English knights
appearing in suits of silk. It appears also by the 33d of
Henry VI., cap. 5, that there was a company of silk-women
in England as early as the year 1455; but these
were probably employed rather in embroidering and making
small haberdasheries, than in the broad manufacture, which
was not introduced till the year 1620.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Gresham, in a letter to Sir William Cecil,
Elizabeth’s great minister, dated Antwerp, April 30th,
1560, says: “I have written into Spain for silk hose both
for you and my lady, your wife, to whom, it may please
you, I may be remembered.” These silk hose, of a black
color, were accordingly soon after sent by Gresham to
Cecil.<a id="Marker_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="marker">817</a></p>

<p>Hose were, in England, up to the time of Henry VIII.,
made out of ordinary cloth: the King’s own were formed
of yard-wide taffata. It was only by chance that he might
obtain a pair of silk hose from Spain. His son, Edward VI.,
received as a present from Sir Thomas Gresham&mdash;Stow
speaks of it as a great present&mdash;“a pair of long Spanish
silk stockings.” For some years longer, silk stockings
continued to be a great rarity. “In the second year of
Queen Elizabeth,” says Stow, “her silk-woman, Mistress
Montague, presented her Majesty with a pair of black knit-silk
stockings for a New-Year’s gift; the which, after a few
days’ wearing, pleased her Highness so well, that she sent
for Mistress Montague, and asked her where she had them,
and if she could help her to any more; who answered, saying,
‘I made them very carefully, of purpose only for your
Majesty, and, seeing these please you so well, I will presently
set more in hand.’ ‘Do so,’ quoth the Queen, ‘for
indeed I like silk stockings so well, because they are pleasant,
fine, and delicate, that henceforth I will wear no more
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_239" title="239"></a><!--240.png-->
cloth stockings.’ And from that time to her death the
Queen never wore cloth hose, but only silk stockings.”<a id="Marker_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="marker">818</a></p>

<p>James I., while King of Scotland, is said to have once
written to the Earl of Mar, one of his friends, to borrow a
pair of silk stockings, in order to appear with becoming
dignity before the English Ambassador; concluding his
letter with these words: “For ye would not, sure, that
your King should appear like a scrub before strangers.”
This shows the great rarity of silk articles at that period
in Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1629, the manufacture of silk was become so considerable
in London, that the silk throwsters of the city and parts
adjacent were incorporated; and in 1661, this company employed
above forty thousand persons. The revocation of
the Edict of Nantes, in 1685, contributed in a great degree
to promote the manufacture of this article; and the invention
of the silk-throwing machine at Derby, in 1719, added
so much to the reputation of English manufactures, that
even in Italy, according to Keysler, the English silks bore
a higher price than the Italian.<a id="Marker_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="marker">819</a></p>

<p>Rev. Stephen Olin tells us that the Mohammedans of
Arabia will not allow strangers to look into their cocooneries,
on account of their superstitious fear of the evil eye,
of the influence of which the Silk-worms are thought to be
peculiarly susceptible.<a id="Marker_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="marker">820</a></p>

<p>The silk of the nests of the social caterpillar of the
<i>Bombyx Madrona</i>, was an object of commerce in Mexico in
the time of Montecusuma; and the ancient Mexicans pasted
together the interior layers, which may be written upon
without preparation, to form a white, glossy pasteboard.
Handkerchiefs are still manufactured of it in the Intendency
of Oaxaca.<a id="Marker_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="marker">821</a></p>

<p>A complete nest of these Silk-worms, called in Brazil
<i>sustillo</i>, was sent by the Academy of Sciences and Natural
History to the King of Spain. The naturalist, Don Antonio
Pineda, sent also a piece of this natural silk paper, measuring
a yard and a half, of an elliptical shape, which, however, is
peculiar to them all.<a id="Marker_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="marker">822</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_240" title="240"></a><!--241.png-->

<p>The Chinese fix on rings with threads the females of two
species of wild <i>Bombyx</i>, whose caterpillars produce silk,
and place these insects on a tree, or on some body situated
in the open air, to allow the males, guided by their scent, to
visit them.<a id="Marker_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="marker">823</a></p>

<p>“The manner of the Chinese is,” we read in Purchas’s
Pilgrims, “in the Spring time to revive the Silke-worms
(that lye dead all the Winter) by laying them in the warme
sunne, and (to hasten their quickening, that they may sooner
goe to worke) to put them into bagges, and so hang them
under their childrens armes.”<a id="Marker_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="marker">824</a></p>

<p>In China, the pupæ of the Silk-worms after the silk is
wound off, and the larvæ of a species of Sphinx-moth,
furnish articles for the table, and are considered delicacies.<a id="Marker_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="marker">825</a>
The natives of Madagascar, who eat all kinds of insects,
consider also Silk-worms a great luxury.<a id="Marker_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="marker">826</a></p>

<p>Aldrovandus states that the German soldiers sometimes
fry and eat Silk-worms.<a id="Marker_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="marker">827</a></p>

<p>Dr. James says: “Silk-worms dried, and reduced to a
powder, are, by some, applied to the crown of the head for
removing vertigos and convulsions. The silk, and case or
coat, are of a due temperament between heat and cold, and
corroborate and recruit the vital, natural, and animal
spirits.”<a id="Marker_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="marker">828</a> The cocoons are also the basis of Goddard’s
<i>Drops</i>, and enter into several other compositions, such as
the <i>Confectio de Hyacintho</i>, when made in the best manner.<a id="Marker_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="marker">829</a></p>

<p>With respect to the coloring of silk, we find in “Tseën
Tse Wan,” or thousand character classic, a work that has
been a school-book in China for the last 1200 years, that an
ancient sage by the name of Mih, seeing the white silk colored,
wept on account of its original purity being destroyed.<a id="Marker_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="marker">830</a></p>

<p>Some of the eggs of a wild species of Silk-worm being
sent overland from China to Paris, proved a source of considerable
anxiety to different parties who received them
during the transit, the instructions on the box, instead of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_241" title="241"></a><!--242.png-->
simply stating that it contained the eggs of the <i>wild</i> Silk-worm
Moth, was couched in the following manner by the
French savant who forwarded them: “Must be kept far from
the engines; this box contains <i>savage</i> worms.”<a id="Marker_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="marker">831</a></p>

<p>About twenty-five years ago, during a mania for rearing
Silk-worms, to meet the demand for the eggs of these insects,
fish-spawn was distributed throughout the country.
The humbug was quite as successful as it was curious.</p>

<p>It has been said that the search after the “Golden Fleece”
may be ascribed to the desire to obtain silk.<a id="Marker_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="marker">832</a></p>

<p>As a protection against rifle-balls, the Chinese, who were
engaged in the rebellion of 1853, state that they wore
dresses thickly padded with floss silk; they said that while
the ball had a twist in it, revolving in its course, it caught
up the silk and fastened itself in the garment. One man
declared that he took out six so caught, in one day, after a
severe fight. They said the dress was of more use within a
hundred yards than at long range, when the ball had lost
its revolving motion.<a id="Marker_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="marker">833</a></p>

<p>Vaucanson, the inventor of the famous “automaton duck,”
to revenge himself upon the silk-weavers of Lyons, who had
stoned him because he attempted to simplify the ordinary
loom, is said to have invented a loom on which a donkey
worked silken cloth.<a id="Marker_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="marker">834</a></p>

<p>In 1783, the larvæ of the Moth, <i>Arctia chrysorrhœa</i>,
were so destructive in the neighborhood of London that
subscriptions were opened to employ the poor in cutting off
and collecting the webs; and it is asserted that not less than
eighty bushels were collected and burnt in one day in the
parish of Clapham. And even in some places prayers were
offered up in the churches to avert the calamities of which
they were supposed by the ignorant to be the forerunner.<a id="Marker_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="marker">836</a></p>

<p>If a caterpillar spins its cocoon in a house, it foretells its
desolation by death; if in your clothes, it warns you you
will wear a shroud before the year is out. This superstition
obtains in the Middle States, Virginia, and Maryland.</p>

<p>If Moths, flying in a candle, put it out, it forebodes a
calamity amounting to almost death. This superstition is
pretty general.</p>

<p>Why Moths fly in a candle: Kempfer tells us, there is
found in Japan an insect, which, by reason of its incomparable
beauty, is kept by the Japanese ladies among the curiosities
of their toilets. He calls it a Night-fly, and describes
it as being “about a finger long, slender, round-bodied, with
four wings, two of which are transparent and hid under a
pair of others, which are shining as it were polished, and
most curiously adorned with blue and golden lines and spots.”
The following little fable, which accounts so beautifully for
the flying of Moths in a candle, owes its origin to the unparalleled
beauty of this insect, and is well worthy of being
preserved: The Japanese say that all other Night-flies
(Moths, etc.) fall in love with this particular one, who, to
get rid of their importunities, maliciously bids them, under
the pretense of trying their constancy, to go and bring to
her fire. And the blind lovers, scrupling not to obey her
command, fly to the nearest fire or candle, in which they
never fail to burn themselves to death.<a id="Marker_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="marker">837</a></p>

<p>The following verses, embodying the above fable (except
in several minor particulars) are from the pen of Mrs. A.&nbsp;L.
Ruter Dufour:</p>

<p>Moufet says: “Our North, as well as our West countrymen,
call it (the Moth, <i>Phalaina</i>) <i>Saule</i>, <i>i.e.</i> <i>Psychen,
Animam</i>, the soul; because some silly people in old time
did fancy that the souls of the dead did fly about in the
night seeking light.”<a id="Marker_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="marker">838</a> “Pliny commends a goat’s liver to
drive them away, yet he shews not the means to use it.”<a id="Marker_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="marker">839</a></p>

<p>One of the most highly prized curiosities in the collection
of Horace Walpole, was the silver bell with which the
popes used to curse the caterpillars. This bell was the
work of Benvenuto Cellini, one of the most extraordinary
men of his extraordinary age, and the relievos on it representing
caterpillars, butterflies, and other insects, are said
to have been wonderfully executed.<a id="Marker_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="marker">840</a></p>

<p>In Purchas’s Pilgrims, we read of worms being sprinkled
with holy water to kill them.<a id="Marker_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="marker">841</a></p>

<p>Apuleius says, that if you take the caterpillars from
another garden, and boil them in water with anethum, and
let them cool, and besprinkle the herbs, you will destroy
the existing caterpillars.<a id="Marker_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="marker">842</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_244" title="244"></a><!--245.png-->

<p>Pliny says, that “if a woman having a catamenia strips
herself naked, and walks round a field of wheat, the caterpillars,
worms, beetles, and other vermin, will fall off the
ears of the grain!” This important discovery, according
to Metrodurus of Scepsos, was first made in Cappadocia;
where, in consequence of such multitudes of “Cantharides”
being found to breed there, it was the practice for women to
walk through the middle of the fields with their garments
tucked up above the thighs.<a id="Marker_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="marker">843</a> Columella<a id="Marker_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="marker">844</a> has described this
practice in verse, and Ælian<a id="Marker_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="marker">845</a> also mentions it. Pliny says
further that in other places, again, it is the usage of women
to go barefoot, with the hair disheveled and the girdle loose:
due precaution, however, he seriously observes, must be
taken that this is not done at sunrise, for if so the crop will
wither and dry up.<a id="Marker_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="marker">846</a> Apuleius,<a id="Marker_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="marker">847</a> Columella,<a id="Marker_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="marker">848</a> and Palladius<a id="Marker_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="marker">849</a>
relate the same story. Constantinus, likewise, whose verses,
as translated in Moufet’s Theater of Insects, are as follows:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">But if against this plague no art prevail,</div>
<div class="line">The Trojan arts will do’t, when others fail.</div>
<div class="line">A woman barefoot with her hair untied,</div>
<div class="line">And naked breasts must walk as if she cried,</div>
<div class="line">And after Venus’ sports she must surround</div>
<div class="line">Ten times, the garden beds and orchard ground.</div>
<div class="line">When she hath done, ’tis wonderful to see,</div>
<div class="line">The caterpillars fall off from the tree,</div>
<div class="line">As fast as drops of rain, when with a crook,</div>
<div class="line">For acorns or apples the tree is shook.<a id="Marker_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="marker">850</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This remarkable superstitious remedy for destroying
caterpillars was frequently practiced by the Indians of
America. Schoolcraft, treating of the peculiar superstitions
connected with the menstrual lodge of these people,
says:</p>

<p>“This superstition does not alone exert a malign influence,
or spell, on the human species. Its ominous power,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_245" title="245"></a><!--246.png-->
or charm, is equally effective on the animate creation, at
least on those species which are known to depredate on
their little fields and gardens. To cast a protective spell
around these, and secure the fields against vermin, insects,
the sciurus, and other species, as well as to protect the
crops against blight, the mother of the family chooses a
suitable hour at night, when the children are at rest and
the sky is overcast, and having completely divested herself
of her garments, trails her <i>machecota</i> behind her, and performs
the circuit of the little field.”<a id="Marker_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="marker">851</a></p>

<p>The fat of bears, says Topsel, “some use superstitiously
beaten with oil, wherewith they anoynt their grape-sickles
when they go to vintage, perswading themselves that if
nobody know thereof, their tender vine-branches shall never
be consumed by caterpillars. Others attribute this to the
vertue of bears’ blood.”<a id="Marker_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="marker">852</a></p>

<p>Nicander used “a caterpillar to procure sleep: for so he
writes; and Hieremias Martius thus translates him:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Stamp but with oyl those worms that eat the leaves,</div>
<div class="line i2">  Whose backs are painted with a greenish hue,</div>
<div class="line">Anoint your body with ’t, and whilst that cleaves,</div>
<div class="line i2">  You shall with gentle sleep bid cares adieu.”<a id="Marker_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="marker">853</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of a caterpillar that feeds upon cabbage leaves, the
<i>Eruca officinalis</i> of Schroder, Dr. James says: “Bruised,
or a powder of them, raise a blister like cantharides, and
take off the skin. Moufet says, they will cause the teeth
to fall out of their sockets, and Hippocrates writes, that
they are good for a Quinsey.”<a id="Marker_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="marker">854</a></p>


<h3 id="Psychidae_Wood-carrying_Moth_etc">Psychidæ&mdash;Wood-carrying Moth, etc.</h3>

<p>The larvæ of the Wood-carrying Moth (of the genus
<i>Oiketicus</i>, or <i>Eumeta</i>, Wlk.) of Ceylon, surround themselves
with cases made of stems of leaves, and thorns or pieces of
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_246" title="246"></a><!--247.png-->
twigs bound together by threads, till the whole resembles a
miniature Roman fasces; in fact, an African species of these
insects has obtained the name of “Lictor.” The Germans
have denominated the group <i>Sackträger</i>, and the Singhalese
call them Darra-kattea or “billets of fire-wood,” and regard
the inmates, Tennent says, as human beings, who, as a punishment
for stealing wood in some former state of existence,
have been condemned to undergo a metempsychosis
under the form of these insects.<a id="Marker_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="marker">855</a></p>


<h3 id="Noctuidae_Antler-moth_Cut-worm_etc">Noctuidæ&mdash;Antler-moth, Cut-worm, etc.</h3>

<p>The Antler-moth, <i>Noctua graminis</i>, Linn., has been particularly
observed in Sweden, Norway, Northern Germany,
and even in Greenland, where it does great mischief to
grass-plots and meadows. It is recorded to have done
very great injury in the eastern mountains of Georgenthal,
as well as at Töplitz in Bohemia, where larvæ were in such
large numbers that in four days and a half 200 men found
23 bushels of them, or 4,500,000 in the 60 bushels of mould
which they examined. In Germany it seems to be confined
to high and dry districts, and it never appears there
in wet meadows, but its devastations are sometimes most
extensive, as happened in the Hartz territory in 1816 and
’17, when whole hills that in the evening were clad in the
finest green, were brown and bare the following morning;
and such vast numbers of the caterpillars were there that
the ruts of the roads leading to the hills were full of them,
and the roads being covered with them were even rendered
slippery and dirty by their being crushed in some places.<a id="Marker_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="marker">856</a></p>

<p>The notorious astrologer, William Lilly, alluding to the
comet which appeared in 1677, says: “All comets signify
wars, terrors, and strange events in the world;” and gives
the following curious explanation of the prophetic nature of
these bodies: “The spirits, well knowing what accidents
shall come to pass, do form a star or comet, and give it
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_247" title="247"></a><!--248.png-->
what figure or shape they please, and cause its motion
through the air, that people might behold it, and thence
draw a signification of its events.” Further, a comet appearing
in the Taurus portends “mortality to the greater
part of cattle, as horses, oxen, cows, etc.,” and also “prodigious
shipwrecks, damage in fisheries, monstrous floods,
and destruction of fruit by caterpillars and other vermin.”<a id="Marker_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="marker">857</a></p>

<p>Josselyn, in the account of his voyage to New England,
printed in London in 1674, has the following relation of an
insect which is doubtless a species of <i>Agrotis</i>, probably the
<i>Agrotis telifera:</i> “There is also (in New England) a dark
dunnish Worm or Bug of the bigness of an Oaten-straw,
and an inch long, that in the Spring lye at the Root of
Corn and Garden plants all day, and in the night creep out
and devour them; these in some years destroy abundance
of <i>Indian</i> Corn and Garden plants, and they have but one
way to be rid of them, which the <i>English</i> have learned of
the Indians; And because it is somewhat strange, I shall
tell you how it is, they go out into a field or garden with a
Birchen-dish, and spudling the earth about the roots, for
they lye not deep, they gather their dish full which may
contain a quart or three pints, then they carrie the dish to
the Sea-side when it is ebbing water and set it a swimming,
the water carrieth the dish into the Sea, and within a day
or two you go into your field you may look your eyes out
sooner than find any of them.”<a id="Marker_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="marker">858</a></p>

<p>The Army-worm (larva of <i>Leucania unipunctata</i> of
Haworth), during this our great rebellion, is thought, by
many persons in Western Pennsylvania, to prognosticate
the success or defeat of our armies by the direction it travels.
If toward the North, the South will be victorious; and if
toward the South, the North will conquer. An old gentleman,
who believes that a frog’s foot drawn in chalk above
the door will keep away witches, tells me this worm invariably
travels southward.</p>

<p>This larva was noticed but a few years before the war
began, and then appearing, as it were, in armies, it was
called the Army-worm. The superstitious omen from it
has followed not preceded the name.</p>

<p>Lindenbrog, in his Codex Legum Antiquarum, cum
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_248" title="248"></a><!--249.png-->
Glossario, fol. Francof. 1613, mentions the following superstition:
“The peasants, in many places in Germany, at the
feast of St. John, bind a rope around a stake drawn from a
hedge, and drive it hither and thither, till it catches fire.
This they carefully feed with stubble and dry wood heaped
together, and they spread the collected ashes over their potherbs,
confiding in vain superstition, that by this means
they can drive away Canker-worms. They therefore call
this Nodfeur, q. <i>necessary fire</i>.”</p>

<p>These fires were condemned as sacrilegious, not as if it
had been thought that there was anything unlawful in
kindling a fire in this manner, but because it was kindled
with a superstitious design. They are, however, Du Cange
says, still kindled in France, on the eve of St. John’s day.<a id="Marker_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="marker">859</a></p>


<h3 id="Geometridae_Span-worms">Geometridæ&mdash;Span-worms.</h3>

<p>The Measuring-worm, crawling on your clothes, is
thought to foretell a new suit; on your hands, a pair of

<h3 id="Tineidae_Clothes-moth_Bee-moth_etc">Tineidæ&mdash;Clothes’-moth, Bee-moth, etc.</h3>

<p>In Newton’s Journal of the Arts for December, 1827,
there is the following mention of a new kind of cloth fabricated
by insects: The larvæ of the Moth, <i>Tinea punctata</i>,
or <i>T. padilla</i>, have been directed by M. Habenstreet, of
Munich, so as to work on a paper model suspended from a
ceiling of a room. To this model he can give any form and
dimensions, and he has thus been enabled to obtain square
shawls, an air balloon four feet high, and a woman’s complete
robe, with the sleeves, but without seams. One or
two larvæ can weave a square inch of cloth. A great number
are, of course, employed, and their motions are interdicted
from the parts of the model not to be covered, by
oiling them. The cloth exceeds in fineness the lightest
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_249" title="249"></a><!--250.png-->
gauze, and has been worn as a robe over her court dress by
the Queen of Bavaria.<a id="Marker_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="marker">860</a></p>

<p>Authors are of opinion that the ancients possessed some
secret for preserving garments from the Moth, <i>Tinia tapetzella</i>.
We are told the robes of Servius Tullius were found
in perfect preservation at the death of Sejanus, an interval
of more than five hundred years. Pliny gives as a precaution
“to lay garments on a coffin;” others recommend “cantharides
hung up in a house, or wrapping them in a lion’s
skin”&mdash;“the poor little insects,” says Reaumur, “being
probably placed in bodily fear of this terrible animal.”<a id="Marker_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="marker">861</a></p>

<p>Moufet says: “They that sell woollen clothes use to wrap
up the skin of a bird called the king’s-fisher among them,
or else hang one in the shop, as a thing by a secret antipathy
that Moths cannot endure.”<a id="Marker_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="marker">862</a></p>

<p>Among the various contrivances resorted to as a safeguard
against the Bee-moth, <i>Galleria cereana</i>, Fabricius,
perhaps the most ingenious is that, mentioned by Langstroth,
of “governing the entrances of all the hives by a
long lever-like <i>hen-roost</i>, so that they may be regularly
closed by the crowing and cackling tribe when they go to
bed at night, and opened again when they fly from their
perch to greet the merry morn.”<a id="Marker_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="marker">863</a></p>

<p>An intelligent man informed Langstroth that he paid ten
dollars to a “Bee-quack” professing to have an infallible
secret for protecting Bees against the Moth; and, after the
quack had departed with his money, learned that the secret
consisted in “always keeping strong stocks.”<a id="Marker_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="marker">864</a></p>

<h3 id="Cicadidae_Harvest-flies">Cicadidæ&mdash;Harvest-flies.</h3>

<p>The Cicadas, <i>C. plebeja</i>, Linn., called by the ancient
Greeks, (by whom, as well as by the Chinese, they were kept
in cages for the sake of their song,) <i>Tettix</i>, seem to have been
the favorites of every Grecian bard, from Homer and Hesiod
to Anacreon and Theocritus. Supposed to be perfectly
harmless, and to live only upon dew, they were addressed
by the most endearing epithets, and were regarded
as almost divine. Thus sings the muse of Anacreon:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Happy creature! what below</div>
<div class="line">Can more happy live than thou?</div>
<div class="line">Seated on thy leafy throne,</div>

<div class="line">Sipping o’er the pearly lawn,</div>
<div class="line">The fragrant nectar of the dawn,</div>
<div class="line">Little tales thou lov’st to sing,</div>
<div class="line">Tales of mirth&mdash;an insect king.</div>
<div class="line">Thine the treasures of the field,</div>
<div class="line">All thy own the seasons yield;</div>
<div class="line">Nature paints thee for the year,</div>
<div class="line">Songster to the shepherds dear;</div>
<div class="line">Innocent, of placid fame,</div>
<div class="line">What of man can boast the same?</div>
<div class="line">Thine the loudest voice of praise,</div>
<div class="line">Harbinger of fruitful days;</div>
<div class="line">Darling of the tuneful nine,</div>
<div class="line">Phœbus is thy sire divine;</div>
<div class="line">Phœbus to thy note has given</div>

<div class="line">Blood nor flesh thy life sustain;</div>
<div class="line">Rich in spirits&mdash;health thy feast,</div>
<div class="line">Thou art a demi-god at least.</div>
</div>
</div>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_251" title="251"></a><!--252.png-->

<p>But the old witticism, attributed to the incorrigible Rhodian
sensualist, Xenarchus, gives quite a different reason to
account for the supposed happiness of these insects:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Happy the Cicadas’ lives,</div>
<div class="line">Since they all have voiceless wives!<a id="Marker_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="marker">865</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Plutarch, reasoning upon that singular Pythagorean precept
which forbid the wife to admit swallows in the house,
remarks: “Consider, and see whether the swallow be not
odious and impious … because she feedeth upon flesh,
and, besides, killeth and devoureth especially grasshoppers
(Cicadas), which are sacred and musical.”<a id="Marker_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="marker">866</a></p>

<p>The Athenians were so attached to the Cicadas, that
their elders were accustomed to fasten golden images of
them in their hair. Thucidides incidentally remarks that
this custom ceased but a little before his time. He adds,
also, that the fashion prevailed, too, for a long time with
the elders of the Ionians, from their affinity to the Athenians.<a id="Marker_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="marker">867</a></p>

<p>This singular form, for their ornamental combs, seems to
have been adopted originally from the predilection of the
Athenians for whatever bore any affinity to themselves, who
boasted of being autochthones or aboriginal. It is sung of
the Athenians:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Blithe race! whose mantles were bedeck’d</div>
<div class="line">With golden grasshoppers, in sign that they</div>
<div class="line">Had sprung, like those bright creatures, from the soil</div>
<div class="line">Whereon their endless generations dwelt.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Michell supposes the Athenians to have imitated in
this instance their prototypes, the Egyptians; for as they,
he adds, wore their favorite symbol, the Scarabæus, in this
manner, so Attic pride set up a rival in the head-dress thus
introduced by Cecrops and his followers.<a id="Marker_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="marker">868</a></p>

<p>From a very ancient writer,<a id="Marker_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="marker">869</a> we have similar ornaments
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_252" title="252"></a><!--253.png-->
ascribed to the Samians. They also most probably derived
this fashion from the early Athenians.<a id="Marker_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="marker">870</a></p>

<p>It seems, from the following lines of Asius,<a id="Marker_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="marker">871</a> that Cicadas
were also worn as ornaments on dresses:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Clad in magnificent robes, whose snow-white folds</div>
<div class="line">Reach’d to the ground of the extensive earth,</div>
<div class="line">And golden knobs on them like grasshoppers.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sound of the Cicada and that of the harp were called
by the Greeks by one and the same name; and a Cicada
sitting upon a harp was the usual emblem of the science of
music. This was accounted for by the following very pleasing
and elegant tale: Two rival musicians, Eunomis of
Locris and Aristo of Rhegium, when alternately playing
upon the harp, the former was so unfortunate as to break a
string of his instrument, and by which accident would certainly
have lost the prize, when a Cicada, flying to him and
sitting upon his harp, supplied the place of the broken
string with its melodious voice, and so secured to him an
easy victory over his antagonist.<a id="Marker_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="marker">872</a></p>

<p>To excel the Cicada in singing was the highest commendation
of a singer, and the music of Plato’s eloquence
was only comparable to the voice of this insect. Homer
compared his good orators to the Cicadæ, “which, in the
woods, sitting on a tree, send forth a delicate voice.”<a id="Marker_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="marker">873</a> But
Virgil speaks of them as insects of a disagreeable and
stridulous tone, and accuses them of bursting the very
shrubs with their <span class="no-wrap">noise,&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Et cantu querulæ rumpent arbusta Cicadæ.<a id="Marker_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="marker">874</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Moufet says: “The Cicadæ, abounding in the end of spring,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_253" title="253"></a><!--254.png-->
do foretel a sickly year to come, not that they are the cause
of putrefaction in themselves, but only shew plenty of putrid
matter to be, when there is such store of them appear.
Oftentimes their coming and singing doth portend the
happy state of things: so also says Theocritus. Niphus
saith that what year but few of them are to be seen, they
presage dearness of victuals, and scarcity of all things
else.…</p>

<p>“The Egyptians, by a Cicada painted, understood a
priest and an holy man; the latter makers of hieroglyphics
sometimes will have them to signifie musicians, sometimes
pratlers or talkative companions, but very fondly. How
ever the matter be, the Cicada hath sung very well of herself,
in my judgement, in this following distich:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Although I am an insect very small,</div>
<div class="line">Yet with great virtue am endow’d withall.”<a id="Marker_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="marker">875</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sir G. Staunton, in his account of China, remarks: “The
shops of Hai-tien, in addition to necessaries, abounded in
toys and trifles, calculated to amuse the rich and idle of
both sexes, even to cages containing insects, such as the
noisy Cicada, and a large species of the Gryllus.”<a id="Marker_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="marker">876</a></p>

<p>S. Wells Williams tells us that the Chinese boys often
capture the male Cicada of their country, and tie a straw
around the abdomen, so as to irritate the sounding apparatus,
and carry it through the streets in this predicament,
to the great annoyance of every one, for the stridulous
sound of this insect is of deafening loudness.<a id="Marker_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="marker">877</a></p>

<p>When in Quincy, Illinois, in the summer of 1864, I was
shown by a boy a toy, which he called a “Locust,” with
which he imitated the loud rattling noise of the <i>Cicada
septemdecim</i> with great accuracy. It consisted of a horse-hair
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_254" title="254"></a><!--255.png-->
tied to the end of a short stick, and looped in a cap of
stiff writing-paper placed over the hole of a spool. To make
the sound, then, the toy was whirled rapidly through the
air, when the stiff paper acted as a sounding-board to the
vibrating hair.</p>

<p>At Surinam, Madame Merian tells us, the noise of the
<i>Cicada tibicen</i> is still supposed to resemble the sound of a
harp or lyre, and hence called the <i>Lierman</i>&mdash;the harper.<a id="Marker_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="marker">878</a>
Another species, in Ceylon, which makes the forest re-echo
with a long-sustained noise so curiously resembling that of
a cutler’s wheel, has acquired the highly appropriate name
of the <i>Knife-grinder</i>.<a id="Marker_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="marker">879</a></p>

<p>It is said of our <i>Cicada septemdecim</i>, the so-called, but
very improperly, “Seventeen-year Locust,” that, when they
first leave the earth, when they are plump and full of juices,
they have been made use of in the manufacture of soap.</p>

<p>The larva of a Chinese species of Cicada, the <i>Flata limbata</i>,
which scarcely exceeds the domestic fly in size, forms
a sort of grease, which adheres to the branches of trees and
hardens into wax. In autumn the natives scrape this substance,
which they call <i>Pela</i>, from off the trees, melt, purify,
and form it into cakes. It is white and glossy in appearance,
and, when mixed with oil, is used to make candles,
and is said to be superior to the common wax for use. The
physicians employ it in several diseases; and the Chinese,
as we are informed by the Abbe Grosier, when they are
about to speak in public, or when any occasion is likely to
occur on which it may be necessary to have assurance and
resolution, eat an ounce of it to prevent swoonings or palpitations
of the heart.<a id="Marker_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="marker">880</a></p>

<p>On the large cheese-like cakes of this wax, hanging in the
grocers’ and tallow-chandlers’ shops at Hankow, are often
seen the inscription written: “It mocks at the frost, and
rivals the snow.” The price, in 1858, was forty dollars a
picul, or about fifteen pence a pound.<a id="Marker_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="marker">881</a></p>

<p>The Greeks, notwithstanding their veneration for the
Cicada, made these insects an article of food, and accounted
them delicious. Aristotle says, the larva, when it is grown
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_255" title="255"></a><!--256.png-->
in the earth, and become a tettigometra (pupa), is the sweetest;
when changed to the tettix, the males at first have the
best flavor, but after impregnation the females are preferred,
on account of their white ova.<a id="Marker_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="marker">882</a> Athenæus and Aristophanes
also mention their being eaten; and Ælian is extremely
angry with the men of his age that an animal sacred to the
Muses should be strung, sold, and greedily devoured.<a id="Marker_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="marker">883</a> The
<i>Cicada septemdecim</i>, Mr. Collinson in 1763 said, was eaten
by the Indians of America, who plucked off the wings and
boiled them.<a id="Marker_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="marker">884</a></p>

<p>Osbeck tells us that the <i>Cicada chinensis</i>, along with
the <i>Buprestis maxima</i>, and several species of Butterflies, is
made an article of commerce by the Chinese, being sold in
their shops.<a id="Marker_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="marker">885</a></p>


<h3 id="Fulgoridae_Lantern-flies">Fulgoridæ&mdash;Lantern-flies.</h3>

<p>The Lantern-fly, <i>Fulgora lanternaria</i> of Linnæus, found in
many parts of South America, is supposed to emit a vivid light
from the large hood, or lantern, which projects from its body,
and to be frequently serviceable to benighted travelers; hence
the specific name, <i>lanternaria</i>. This story originated about a
century and a half ago, from the work of the celebrated Madame
Merian, who lived several years in Surinam. Her account
contains the following anecdote: “The Indians once
brought me, before I knew that they shone by night, a number
of these Lantern-flies, which I shut up in a wooden box. In
the night they made such a noise that I awoke in a fright,
and ordered a light to be brought; not knowing whence the
noise proceeded. As soon as we found that it came from
the box, we opened it; but were still much more alarmed,
and let it fall to the ground, in a fright at seeing a flame of
fire come out of it; and as so many animals as came out,
so many flames of fire appeared. When we found this to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_256" title="256"></a><!--257.png-->
be the case, we recovered from our fright, and again collected
the insects, highly admiring their splendid appearance.”<a id="Marker_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="marker">886</a></p>

<p>Dr. Darwin, in a note to some lines relative to luminous
insects, in his poem, the Loves of the Plants, makes Madame
Merian affirm that she drew and finished her figure of the
insect by its own light. This story is without foundation.</p>

<p>The Indians of South America say and believe that the
Lyerman, <i>Cicada tibicen</i>, is changed into the Lantern-fly;
and that the latter emits a light similar to that of a lantern.<a id="Marker_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="marker">887</a></p>

<p>This story of the Lantern-fly being luminous is the more
remarkable since the veracity of its author is unimpeached.
She doubtless has confounded it with the <i>Cucujus</i>, <i>Elater
noctilucus</i>. Donovan, however, states that the Chinese
Lantern-fly, <i>Fulgora candelaria</i>, has an illuminated appearance
in the night.<a id="Marker_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="marker">888</a></p>

<p>From the loud noise the Lantern-fly makes at night, which
is said to be somewhat between the grating of a razor-grinder
and the clang of cymbals, it is called by the Dutch,
in Guiana, <i>Scare-sleep</i>.<a id="Marker_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="marker">889</a> Ligon, in his History of Barbados,
printed in 1673, probably refers to this insect, when he says:
“They lye all day in holes and hollow trees, and as
soon as the Sun is down they begin their tunes, which are
neither singing nor crying, but the shrillest voyces that ever
I heard; nothing can be so nearly resembled to it, as the
mouths of a pack of small beagles at a distance.” This
author, however, thought this sound by no means unpleasant.
“So lively and chirping,” he continues, “the noise is, as
nothing can be more delightful to the ears, if there were not
too much of it, for the musick hath no intermission till
morning, and then all is husht.”<a id="Marker_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="marker">890</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_257" title="257"></a><!--258.png-->


<h3 id="Aphidae_Plant-lice">Aphidæ&mdash;Plant-lice.</h3>

<p>The Aphides are remarkable for secreting a sweet, viscid
fluid, known by the name of Honey-dew, the origin of which
has puzzled the world for ages. Pliny says “it is either a
certaine sweat of the skie, or some unctuous gellie proceeding
from the starres, or rather a liquid purged from the aire
when it purifyeth itself.”<a id="Marker_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="marker">891</a></p>

<p>Amyntas, in his Stations of Asia, quoted by Athenæus,
gives a curious account of the manner of collecting this
article, which was supposed to be superior to the nectar of
the Bee, in various parts of the East, particularly in Syria.
In some cases they gathered the leaves of trees, chiefly of
the linden and oak, for on these the dew was most abundantly
found,<a id="Marker_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="marker">892</a> and pressed them together. Others allowed it
to drop from the leaves and harden into globules, which,
when desirous of using, they broke, and, having poured
water on them in wooden bowls, drank the mixture. In
the neighborhood of Mount Lebanon, Honey-dew was collected
plentifully several times in the year, being caught by
spreading skins under the trees, and shaking into them the
liquid from the leaves. The Dew was then poured into
vessels, and stored away for future use. On these occasions
the peasants used to exclaim, “Zeus has been raining
honey!”<a id="Marker_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="marker">893</a></p>

<p>In the Treasvrie of Avncient and Moderne Times, we
read: “<i>Galen</i> saith, that there fell such great quantity of this
Dew (in his time) in his Countrey of <i>Pergamus</i>, that the
Countrey people (greatly delighted therein) gave thankes
therefor to <i>Iupiter</i>. <i>Ælianus</i> writeth also that there fell
such plenty thereof in <i>India</i>, in the Region which is called
<i>Prasia</i>, and so moistened the Grasse, that the Sheepe, Kine,
and Goates feeding thereon, yeelded Milke sweete like Hony,
which was very pleasing to drinke. And when they used
that Milke in any disease, they needed not to put any Hony
therein, to the end it should not corrupt in the stomacke:
as it is appointed in Hecticke Feauers, Consumption,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_258" title="258"></a><!--259.png-->
Tisickes, and for others that are ulcered in the intestines, as
is confirmed by the Histories of <i>Portugall</i>.”<a id="Marker_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="marker">894</a></p>

<p>The Aphides, like many other insects, sometimes migrate
in clouds; and among other instances on record of these
migrations, Mr. White informs us that about three o’clock
in the afternoon of the first of August, 1785, the people of
the village of Selborne were surprised by a shower of
Aphides which fell in those parts. Persons who walked in
the street at this time found themselves covered with them,
and they settled in such numbers in the gardens and on the
hedges as to blacken every leaf. Mr. White’s annuals were
thus all discolored with them, and the stalks of a bed of
onions were quite coated over for six days afterward. These
swarms, he remarks, were then no doubt in a state of emigration,
and might have come from the great hop-plantations
of Kent and Sussex, the wind being all that day in the east.
They were observed at the same time in great clouds about
Farnham, and all along the vale from Farnham to Alton.<a id="Marker_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="marker">895</a>
A similar emigration of these insects Mr. Kirby once witnessed,
to his great annoyance, when traveling later in the
year in the Isle of Ely. The air was so full of them, that
they were incessantly flying into his eyes and nostrils, and
his clothes were covered by them; and in 1814, in the autumn,
the Aphides were so abundant for a few days in the
vicinity of Ipswich, as to be noticed with surprise by the most
incurious observers.<a id="Marker_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="marker">896</a> Neither Mr. White nor Mr. Kirby
informs us what particular species formed these immense
flights, but it is most probable they belonged to the Hop-fly,
<i>Aphis humuli</i>.</p>

<p>Reaumur tells us that in the Levant, Persia, and China,
they use the galls of a particular species of <i>Aphis</i> for dyeing
silk crimson.<a id="Marker_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="marker">897</a></p>

<p>In England, the mischief caused by the Hop-fly, <i>Aphis
humuli</i>, in some seasons, as in 1802, has brought the duty
of hops down from £100,000 to £14,000.</p>

<p>A quite common, though erroneous, belief in England is,
that Aphides are produced, or brought by, a northern or eastern
wind. Thomson has fallen into the error; he has also
confounded the mischief of caterpillars with that of the Aphis:</p>

<h3 id="Coccidae_Shield-lice">Coccidæ&mdash;Shield-lice.</h3>

<p>The Kermes-dye, or scarlet, made from the <i>Coccus ilicis</i>
of Linnæus, an insect found chiefly on a species of oak, the
<i>Quercus ilex</i>, in the Levant, France, Spain, and other parts
of the world, was known in the East in the earliest ages,
even before the time of Moses, and was a discovery of the
Phœnicians in Palestine, who also first employed the murex
and buccinum for the purpose of dyeing.</p>

<p><i>Tola</i> or <i>Thola</i> was the ancient Phœnician name for this
insect and dye, which was used by the Hebrews, and even
by the Syrians; for it is employed by the Syrian translator.<a id="Marker_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="marker">898</a>
Among the Jews, after their captivity, the Aramæan <i>zehori</i>
was more common. This dye was known also to the Egyptians
in the time of Moses; and it is most probable that the
color mentioned in Exodus<a id="Marker_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="marker">899</a> as one of the three which were
prescribed for the curtains of the tabernacle, and for the
“holy garments” of Aaron, and which the English translators
have rendered by the word <i>scarlet</i> (not the color now
so called, which was not known in James the First’s reign
when the Bible was translated), was no other than the blood-red
color dyed from the <i>Coccus ilicis</i>.</p>

<p>The Arabs received the name <i>Kermes</i> or <i>Alkermes</i> for
the insect and dye, from Armenia and Persia, where the
insect was indigenous, and had long been known; and that
name banished the old name in the East, as the name scarlet
has in the West. For the first part of this assertion we
must believe the Arabs. The Kermes, however, were not
indigenous to Arabia, as the Arabs appear to have no name
for them. To the Greeks this dye was known under the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_260" title="260"></a><!--261.png-->
name of <i>Coccus</i>, as appears from Dioscorides, and other
Greek writers.<a id="Marker_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="marker">900</a></p>

<p>From the epithets <i>kermes</i> and <i>coccus</i>, and that of <i>vermiculus</i>
or <i>vermiculum</i>, given to the Kermes in the middle
ages, when they were ascertained to be insects, have sprung
the Latin <i>coccineus</i>, the French <i>carmesin</i>, <i>carmine</i>, <i>cramoisi</i>
and <i>vermeil</i>, the Italian <i>chermisi</i>, <i>cremisino</i>, and
<i>chermesino</i>, and our <i>crimson</i> and <i>vermilion</i>.</p>

<p>The imperishable reds of the Brussels and other Flemish
tapestries were derived from the Kermes; and, in short,
previous to the discovery of cochineal, this was the material
universally used for dyeing the most brilliant red then
known. At the present time the Kermes are only gathered
in Europe by the peasantry of the provinces in which they
are found, but they still continue to be employed as of old
in a great part of India and Persia.<a id="Marker_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="marker">901</a></p>

<p>Brookes says the women gather the harvest of Kermes
insects before sunrise, tearing them off with their nails;
and, for fear there should be any loss from the hatching of
the insects, they sprinkle them with vinegar. They then
lay them in the sun to dry, where they acquire a red color.<a id="Marker_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="marker">902</a></p>

<p>The scarlet grain of Poland, <i>Coccus polonicus</i>, found
on the German knot-grass or perennial knawel (<i>Scleranthus
perennis</i>), was at one time collected in large quantities in
the Ukraine and other provinces of Poland (here under the
name of <i>Czerwiec</i>), and also in the great duchy of Lithuania.
But though much esteemed and still employed by
the Turks and Armenians for dyeing wool, silk, and hair,
as well as for staining the nails of women’s fingers, it is
now rarely used in Europe except by the Polish peasantry.
A similar neglect has attended the Coccus found on the
roots of the Burnet (<i>Poterium sanguisorba</i>, Linn.), which
was used, particularly by the Moors, for dyeing wool and
silk a rose color; and the <i>Coccus uvæ-ursi</i>, which with
alum affords a crimson dye.<a id="Marker_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="marker">903</a></p>

<p>Cochineal, the <i>Coccus cacti</i>, is doubtless the most valuable
product for which the dyer is indebted to insects, and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_261" title="261"></a><!--262.png-->
with the exception perhaps of indigo, the most important of
dyeing materials. It is found on a kind of fig, called in
Mexico, where the insect is produced in any quantity, Nopal
or Tuna, which generally has been supposed to be the
<i>Cactus cochinilifer</i>, but according to Humboldt is unquestionably
a distinct species, which bears fruit internally
white.</p>

<p>Cochineal was discovered by the Spaniards, on their
first arrival in Mexico, about the year 1518; but who first
remarked this valuable production, and made it known in
Europe, Mr. Beckman says, he has been unable to discover.
Some assert that the native Mexicans, before the landing
of Cortes, were acquainted with cochineal, which they
employed in painting their houses and dyeing their clothes;
but others maintain the contrary. Be that as it may, however,
the Spanish ministry, as early as the year 1523, as
Herrera informs us, ordered Cortes to take measures for
multiplying this valuable commodity; and soon after it
must have begun to be quite an object of commerce, for
Guicciardini, who died in 1589, mentions it among the
articles procured then by the merchants of Antwerp from
Spain.</p>

<p>Professor Beckman, who has given the subject particular
attention, thinks that with the first cochineal, a true account
of the manner in which it was procured must have
reached Europe, and become publicly known. Acosta in
1530, and Herrera in 1601, as well as Hernandez and
others, gave so true and complete a description of it, that
the Europeans could entertain no doubt respecting its
origin. The information of these authors, however, continues
this gentleman, was either overlooked or considered
as false, and disputes arose whether cochineal was insects
or worms, or the berries or seeds of certain plants. The
Spanish name <i>grana</i>, confounded with <i>granum</i>, may have
given rise to this contest.</p>

<p>Illustrative of this great difference of opinion, Mr. Beckman
narrates the following anecdote: “A Dutchman,
named Melchior de Ruusscher, affirmed in a society, from
oral information he had received in Spain, that cochineal
was small animals. Another person, whose name he has
not made known, maintained the contrary with so much
heat and violence, that the dispute at length ended in a
bet. Ruusscher charged a Spaniard, one of his friends,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_262" title="262"></a><!--263.png-->
who was going to Mexico, to procure for him in that country
authentic proofs of what he had asserted. These proofs,
legally confirmed in October, 1725, by the court of justice
in the city of Antiquera, in the valley of Oaxaca, arrived at
Amsterdam in the autumn of the year 1726. I have been
informed that Ruusscher upon this got possession of the
sum betted, which amounted to the whole property of the
loser; but that, after keeping it a certain time, he again returned
it, deducting only the expenses he had been at in
procuring the evidence, and in causing it to be published.
It formed a small octavo volume, with the following title
printed in red letters: <i>The History of Cochineal proved
by Authentic documents</i>. These proofs sent from New-Spain
are written in Dutch, French, and Spanish.”<a id="Marker_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="marker">904</a></p>

<p>Among the important discoveries made by accident, the
following in the history of Cochineal may be instanced:
“The well-known Cornelius Drebbel, who was born at
Alcmaar, and died at London in 1634, having placed in his
window an extract of Cochineal, made with boiling water,
for the purpose of filling a thermometer, some aqua-regia
dropped into it from a phial, broken by accident, which
stood above it, and converted the purple dye into a most
beautiful dark red. After some conjectures and experiments,
he discovered that the tin by which the window
frame was divided into squares had been dissolved by the
aqua-regia, and was the cause of this change. He communicated
his observation to Kuffelar, an ingenious dyer
at Leyden. The latter brought the discovery to perfection,
and employed it some years alone in his dye-house, which
gave rise to the name of Kuffelar’s color.”<a id="Marker_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="marker">905</a></p>

<p>That innocent cosmetic, so much used by the ladies, and
commonly known by the French term Rouge, is no other
than a preparation of Cochineal.<a id="Marker_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="marker">906</a></p>

<p>Kermes-berries, <i>Coccus ilicis</i>, and Cochineal, <i>C. cacti</i>,
Geoffroy says, “are esteemed to be greatly cordial and
sudorific, being very full of volatile salt. They are given
also to prevent abortion from any strain or hurt.”<a id="Marker_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="marker">907</a></p>

<p><i>Lac</i> is the produce of an insect supposed by Amatus
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_263" title="263"></a><!--264.png-->
Lusitanus to be a kind of ant, and by others a bee, but now
ascertained to be a species belonging to the Coccidæ&mdash;the
<i>Coccus ficus</i> or <i>C. lacca</i>. It is collected from various trees
in India, where it is found so abundantly, that, were the
consumption ten times greater than it is, it could be readily
supplied.</p>

<p>Lac is known in Europe by the different appellations of
<i>stick-lac</i>, when in its natural state, adhering to, and often
completely surrounding, for five or six inches, the twigs on
which it is produced by the insects contained in its cells;
<i>seed-lac</i>, when broken into small pieces, garbled, and the
greater part of the coloring matter extracted by water;
when it appears in a granulated form; <i>lump-lac</i>, when
melted and made into cakes; and <i>shell-lac</i>, when strained
and formed into transparent laminæ.</p>

<p>Lac, in its different forms, is made use of in the manufacture
of varnishes, japanned ware, sealing-wax, beads,
rings, arm-bracelets, necklaces, water-proof hats, etc., etc.
Mixed with fine sand it forms grindstones; and added to
lamp or ivory black, being first dissolved in water with the
addition of a little borax, it composes an ink not easily
acted upon by dampness or water. It has been applied
also to a still more important purpose, originally suggested
by Dr. Roxburgh about the year 1790&mdash;that of a substitute
for Cochineal in dyeing scarlet.<a id="Marker_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="marker">908</a> From this suggestion,
under the direction of Dr. Bancroft, large quantities of a
substance termed <i>lac-lake</i>, consisting of the coloring matter
of stick-lac precipitated from an alkaline lixivium by alum,
were manufactured at Calcutta and sent to England, where
at first the consumption was so great, that, according to
the statement of Dr. Bancroft, in 1806, and the two following
years, the sales of it at the India House equaled in
point of coloring matter half a million of pounds’ weight of
Cochineal. Soon after this, a new preparation of lac color,
under the name of <i>lac-dye</i>, was substituted for the lac-lake,
and with such advantage, that in a few months £14,000
were saved by the East India Company in the purchase of
scarlet cloths dyed with this color and Cochineal conjointly,
and without any inferiority in the color obtained.<a id="Marker_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="marker">909</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_264" title="264"></a><!--265.png-->

<p>The Coccidæ, although they furnish an invaluable dye
and many articles of commerce, are among the most hurtful
of insects in gardens and hot-houses. In 1843, the orange-trees
of the Azores or Western Islands were nearly entirely
destroyed by the <i>Coccus Hesperidum;</i> and in Fayal, an
island which had usually exported twelve thousand chests
of oranges annually, not one was exported.<a id="Marker_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="marker">910</a></p>

<h3 id="Cimicidae_Bed-bugs">Cimicidæ&mdash;Bed-bugs.</h3>

<p>“In the year 1503,” says Moufet, “Dr. Penny was called
in great haste to a little village, called Mortlake, near the
Thames, to visit two noble ladies (<i>duas nobiles</i>), who were
much frightened by the appearance of bug-bites (<i>ex cinicum
vestigiis</i>), and were in fear of I know not what contagion;
but when the matter was known, and the insects caught, he
laughed them out of all fear.”<a id="Marker_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="marker">911</a></p>

<p>This fact disproves the statement of Southall, that the
<i>Cimex lectularius</i> was not known in England before 1670,
and that of Linnæus, and the generality of later writers,
that this insect is not originally a native of Europe, but was
introduced into England after the great fire of London in
1666, having been brought in timber from America.</p>

<p>The original English names of the <i>C. lectularius</i>, were
<i>Chinche</i>, <i>Wall-louse</i>, and <i>Punaise</i> (from the French);
and the term <i>Bug</i>, which is a Celtic word, signifying a
ghost or goblin, was applied to them after the time of Ray,<a id="Marker_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="marker">912</a>
most probably because they were considered as “terrors of
the night.”<a id="Marker_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="marker">913</a></p>

<p>In the Nicholson’s Journal<a id="Marker_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="marker">914</a> there is mention of a man
who, far from disliking Bed-bugs, took them under his protecting
care, and would never suffer them to be disturbed,
or his bedsteads removed, till in the end they swarmed to an
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_266" title="266"></a><!--267.png-->
incredible degree, crawling up even the walls of his drawing-room;
and after his death millions were found in his
bed and chamber furniture.</p>

<p>Gemelli, in 1695, visited the Banian hospital at Surat,
and says that what amazed him most, though he went there
for that express purpose, was to see “a poor wretch, naked,
bound down hands and feet, to feed the Bugs or Punaises,
brought out of their stinking holes for that purpose.”<a id="Marker_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="marker">915</a></p>

<p>Mr. Forbes, speaking of this remarkable institution for
animals, says: “At my visit, the hospital contained horses,
mules, oxen, sheep, goats, monkeys, poultry, pigeons, and a
variety of birds. The most extraordinary ward was that
appropriated to rats and mice, Bugs, and other noxious vermin.
The overseers of the hospital frequently hire beggars
from the streets, for a stipulated sum, to pass a night among
the Fleas, Lice, and Bugs, on the express condition of suffering
them to enjoy their feast without molestation.”<a id="Marker_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="marker">916</a></p>

<p>Navarette says that a species of Bugs (most probably a
<i>Cimex</i>), which swarm in some parts of China, are a source
of great amusement to the natives; for they take particular
delight in killing them with their fingers, and then clapping
them to their noses.<a id="Marker_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="marker">917</a></p>

<p>Democritus says that the feet of a hare, or of a stag,
hung round the feet of the bed at the bottom of the couch,
does not suffer Bugs to breed; but, in traveling, Didymus
adds, if you fill a vessel with cold water and set it under the
bed, they will not touch you when you are asleep.<a id="Marker_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="marker">918</a></p>

<p>A superstition prevails among us that beds, in order to
rid them effectually of Bugs, must be cleaned during the
dark of the moon.</p>

<p>The medicinal virtues of the Cimex are given by Pliny
(doubtless quoting Dioscorides, ii. 36) as follows: “The
Bug is said to be a neutralizer of the venom of serpents,
asps in particular, and to be a preservative against all kinds
of poisons. As a proof of this, they tell us that the sting
of an asp is never fatal to poultry, if they have eaten Bugs
that day; and that, if such is the case, their flesh is remarkably
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_267" title="267"></a><!--268.png-->
beneficial to persons who have been stung by serpents.
Of the various recipes given in reference to these insects,
the least revolting are the application of them externally to
the wound, with the blood of a tortoise; the employment of
them as a fumigation to make leeches loose their hold; and
the administering of them to animals in drink when a leech
has been accidentally swallowed. Some persons, however,
go so far as to crush Bugs with salt and woman’s milk, and
anoint the eyes with the mixture; in combination, too,
with honey and oil of roses, they use them as an injection
for the ears. Field-bugs, again, and those found upon the
mallow (perhaps the <i>Cimex pratensis</i> is meant here; neither
this nor the <i>Cimex juniperinus</i>, the <i>C. brassicæ</i>, or the
<i>Lygæus hyoscami</i>, has the offensive smell of the <i>C. lectularius</i>)
are burnt, and the ashes mixed with oil of roses as an
injection for the ears.</p>

<p>“As to the other remedial virtues attributed to Bugs for
the cure of vomiting, quartan fevers, and other diseases,
although we find recommendations given to swallow them
in an egg, some wax, or in a bean,<a id="Marker_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="marker">919</a> I look upon them as
utterly unfounded, and not worthy of further notice. They
are employed, however, for the treatment of lethargy, and
with some fair reason, as they successfully neutralize the
narcotic effects of the poison of the asp; for this purpose
seven of them are administered in a cyathus of water; but
in the case of children, only four. In cases, too, of strangury
they have been injected into the urinary channel.<a id="Marker_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="marker">920</a> So
true it is that nature, that universal parent, has engendered
nothing without some powerful reason or other. In addition
to these particulars, a couple of Bugs, it is said, attached
to the left arm in some wool that has been stolen
from the shepherds, will effectually cure nocturnal fevers;
while those recurrent in the daytime may be treated with
equal success by inclosing the Bugs in a piece of russet-colored
cloth.”<a id="Marker_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="marker">921</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_268" title="268"></a><!--269.png-->

<p>Guettard, a French commentator on Pliny, recommends
Bugs to be taken internally for hysteria; and Dr. James
says “the smell of them relieves under hysterical suffocations!”<a id="Marker_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="marker">922</a></p>

<p>At the present time the Bed-bug is sometimes given by
the country people of Ohio as a cure for the fever and ague.</p>

<p>Moufet says: “The verses of Quintus Serenus show that
they are good for tertian agues:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Shame not to drink three Wall-lice mixt with wine,</div>
<div class="line i2">  And garlick bruised together at noon-day.</div>
<div class="line">Moreover a bruised Wall-louse with an egg, repine</div>
<div class="line i2">  Not for to take, ’tis loathsome, yet full good I say.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Gesner in his writings confirms this experiment, having
made trial of it among the common and meaner sort of
people in the country. The ancients gave seven to those
that were taken with a lethargy, in a cup of water, and four
to children. Pliny and Serenus consent to this in these
verses:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Some men prescribe seven Wall-lice for to drink,</div>
<div class="line">Mingled with water, and one cup they think</div>
<div class="line">Is better than with drowsy death to sink.”<a id="Marker_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="marker">923</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Anatolius says that if an ox, or other quadruped, swallows
a leech in drinking, having pounded some Bugs, let
the animal smell them, and he immediately throws up the
leech.<a id="Marker_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="marker">924</a></p>

<p>Mr. Mayhew, in his work on the London poor and their
labor, has an interesting chapter devoted to the Destroyers
of Vermin, from which we have taken the liberty of quoting
pretty largely in the course of this work. His statements
can be relied on, and we give them as nearly in his own
words as possible. Concerning Bugs and Fleas, and the
trade carried on in the manufacture and vending of poisons
to destroy these pests, we learn from him: The vending of
bug-poison in the London streets is seldom followed as a
regular source of living. He has met with persons who remembered
to have seen men selling packets of vermin poison;
but to find out the venders themselves was next to an
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_269" title="269"></a><!--270.png-->
impossibility. The men seem to take merely to the business
as a living when all other sources have failed. All, however,
agree in acknowledging that there is such a street trade;
but that the living it affords is so precarious that few men
stop at it longer than two or three weeks.</p>

<p>The most eminent firm, perhaps, of the bug-destroyers in
London now is that of Messrs. Tiffin and Son. They have
pursued their calling in the streets, but now rejoice in the
title of “Bug-Destroyers to Her Majesty and the Royal
Family.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tiffin, the senior party in this house, kindly obliged
Mr. Mayhew with the following statement. It may be as
well to say that Mr. Tiffin appears to have paid much attention
to the subject of Bugs, and has studied with much earnestness
the natural history of this vermin. He said:</p>

<p>“We can trace our business back as far as 1695, when one
of our ancestors first turned his attention to the destruction
of bugs. He was a lady’s stay-maker&mdash;men used to make
them in those days, though, as far back as that is concerned,
it was a man that made my mother’s dresses. This ancestor
found some bugs in his house&mdash;a young colony of them, that
had introduced themselves without his permission, and he
didn’t like their company, so he tried to turn them out of
doors again, I have heard it said, in various ways. It is in
history, and it has been handed down in my own family as
well, that bugs were first introduced into England, after
the fire in London, in the timber that was brought for the
rebuilding of the city, thirty years after the fire, and it was
about that time that my ancestor first discovered the colony
of bugs in his house. I can’t say whether he studied the subject
of bug-destroying, or whether he found out his stuff by
accident, but he certainly <i>did</i> invent a compound which
completely destroyed the bugs, and, having been so successful
in his own house, he named it to some of his customers
who were similarly plagued, and that was the commencement
of the present connection, which has continued
up to this time.</p>

<p>“At the time of the illumination for the Peace, I thought
I must have something over my shop, that would be both
suitable for the event and to my business; so I had a transparency
done, and stretched on a big frame, and lit up by
gas, on which was written</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_270" title="270"></a><!--271.png-->

<p class="epitaph">
<span class="smaller">MAY THE<br /></span>
DESTROYERS OF PEACE<br />
<span class="smaller">BE DESTROYED BY US.</span><br />
TIFFIN &amp; SON,<br />
<span class="smaller">BUG-DESTROYERS TO HER MAJESTY.</span><br />
</p>

<p>“Our business was formerly carried on in the Strand,
where both my father and myself were born; in fact, I may
say I was born to the bug business.</p>

<p>“I remember my father as well as possible; indeed, I
worked with him for ten or eleven years. He used, when
I was a boy, to go out to his work killing bugs at his customers’
houses with a sword by his side and a cocked-hat
and bag-wig on his head&mdash;in fact, dressed up like a regular
dandy. I remember my grandmother, too, when she was
in the business, going to the different houses, and seating
herself in a chair, and telling the men what they were to
do, to clean the furniture and wash the woodwork.</p>

<p>“I have customers in our books for whom our house has
worked these 150 years; that is, my father and self have
worked for them and their fathers. We do the work by
contract, examining the house every year. It’s a precaution
to keep the place comfortable. You see, servants are
apt to bring bugs in their boxes; and, though there may
be only two or three bugs perhaps hidden in the woodwork
and the clothes, yet they soon breed if let alone.</p>

<p>“We generally go in the spring, before the bugs lay their
eggs; or, if that time passes, it ought to be done before
June, before their eggs are hatched, though it’s never too
late to get rid of a nuisance.</p>

<p>“I mostly find the bugs in the bedsteads. But, if they
are left unmolested, they get numerous and climb to the
tops of the rooms, and about the corners of the ceilings.
They colonize anywhere they can, though they’re very
high-minded and prefer lofty places. Where iron bedsteads
are used, the bugs are more in the <i>rooms</i>, and that’s why
such things are bad. They don’t keep a bug away from a
person sleeping. Bugs’ll come if they’re thirty yards off.</p>

<p>“I knew a case of a bug who used to come every night
about thirty or forty feet&mdash;it was an immense large room&mdash;from
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_271" title="271"></a><!--272.png-->
the corner of the room to visit an old lady. There
was only one bug, and he’d been there for a long time. I
was sent for to find him out. It took me a long time to
catch him. In that instance I had to examine every part
of the room, and when I got him I gave him an extra nip
to serve him out. The reason why I was so bothered was,
the bug had hidden itself near the window, the last place I
should have thought of looking for him, for a bug never, by
choice, faces the light; but when I came to inquire about
it, I found that this old lady never rose till three o’clock in
the day, and the window-curtains were always drawn, so
that there was no light like.</p>

<p>“Lord! yes, I am often sent for to catch a single bug.
I’ve had to go many, many miles&mdash;even 100 or 200&mdash;into
the country, and perhaps only catch half a dozen bugs after
all; but then that’s all that are there, so it answers our employer’s
purpose as well as if they were swarming.</p>

<p>“I work for the upper classes only; that is, for carriage-company
and such like approaching it, you know. I have
noblemen’s names, the first in England, on my books.</p>

<p>“My work is more method; and I may call it a scientific
treating of the bugs rather than wholesale murder. We
don’t care about the thousands, it’s the last bug we look for,
whilst your carpenters and upholsterers leave as many behind
them, perhaps, as they manage to catch.</p>

<p>“The bite of the bug is very curious. They bite all persons
the same (?); but the difference of effect lies in the constitutions
of the parties. I’ve never noticed that a different
kind of skin makes any difference in being bitten. Whether
the skin is moist or dry, it don’t matter. Wherever bugs
are, the person sleeping in the bed is sure to be fed on,
whether they are marked or not; and as a proof, when nobody
has slept in the bed for some time, the bugs become
quite flat; and, on the contrary, when the bed is always occupied,
they are round as a lady-bird.</p>

<p>“The flat bug is more ravenous, though even he will allow
you time to go to sleep before he begins with you; or
at least till he thinks you ought to be asleep. When they
find all quiet, not even a light in the room will prevent
their biting; but they are seldom or never found under the
bedclothes. They like a clear ground to get off, and generally
bite round the edges of the nightcap or the nightdress.
When they are found <i>in</i> the bed, it’s because the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_272" title="272"></a><!--273.png-->
parties have been tossing about, and have curled the sheets
round the bugs.</p>

<p>“The finest and fattest bugs I ever saw were those I
found in a black man’s bed. He was the favorite servant
of an Indian general. He didn’t want his bed done by me;
he didn’t want it touched. His bed was full of ’em, no beehive
was ever fuller. The walls and all were the same,
there wasn’t a patch that was not crammed with them. He
must have taken them all over the house wherever he
went.</p>

<p>“I’ve known persons to be laid up for months through
bug-bites. There was a very handsome fair young lady I
knew once, and she was much bitten about the arms, and
neck, and face, so that her eyes were so swelled up she
couldn’t see. The spots rose up like blisters, the same as
if stung with a nettle, only on a very large scale. The
bites were very much inflamed, and after a time they had
the appearance of boils.</p>

<p>“Some people fancy, and it is historically recorded, that
the bug smells because it has no vent; but this is fabulous,
for they <i>have</i> a vent. It is not the human blood neither
that makes them smell, because a young bug who has never
touched a drop will smell. They breathe, I believe, through
their sides; but I can’t answer for that, though it’s not through
the head. They haven’t got a mouth, but they insert into
the skin the point of a tube, which is quite as fine as a hair,
through which they draw up the blood. I have many a
time put a bug on the back of my hand, to see how they
bite; though I never felt the bite but once, and then I suppose
the bug had pitched upon a very tender part, for it was
a sharp prick, something like that of a leech-bite.</p>

<p>“I once had a case of lice-killing, for my process will answer
as well for them as for bugs, though it’s a thing I
never should follow by choice. Lice seem to harbor pretty
much the same as bugs do. I find them in the furniture.
It was a nurse that brought them into the house, though
she was as nice and clean a looking woman as ever I saw.
I should almost imagine the lice must have been in her,
for they say there is a disease of that kind; and if the tics
breed in sheep, why should not lice breed in us? for we’re
but live matter, too. I didn’t like myself at all for two or
three days after that lice-killing job, I can assure you; it’s
the only case of the kind I ever had, and I can promise
you it shall be the last.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_273" title="273"></a><!--274.png-->

<p>“I was once at work on the Princess Charlotte’s own
bedstead. I was in the room, and she asked me if I had
found anything, and I told her no; but just at that minute
I <i>did</i> happen to catch one, and upon that she sprang up on
the bed, and put her head on my shoulder, to look at it.
She had been tormented by the creature, because I was ordered
to come directly, and that was the only one I found.
When the Princess saw it, she said, ‘Oh, the nasty thing!
That’s what tormented me last night; don’t let him escape.’
I think he looked all the better for having tasted royal
blood.</p>

<p>“I also profess to kill beetles, though you never can destroy
them so effectually as you can bugs; for, you see,
beetles run from one house to another, and you can never
perfectly get rid of them; you can only keep them under.
Beetles will scrape their way and make their road round a
fire-place, but how they go from one house to another I
can’t say, but they <i>do</i>.</p>

<p>“I never had patience enough to try and kill Fleas by my
process; it would be too much of a chivey to please me.</p>

<p>“I never heard of any but one man who seriously went to
work selling bug-poison in the streets. I was told by some
persons that he was selling a first-rate thing, and I spent
several days to find him out. But, after all, his secret proved
to be nothing at all. It was train-oil, linseed and hempseed,
crushed up all together, and the bugs were to eat it till they
burst.</p>

<p>“After all, secrets for bug-poisons ain’t worth much, for
all depends upon the application of them. For instance, it
is often the case that I am sent for to find out one bug in a
room large enough for a school. I’ve discovered it when
the creature had been three or four months there, as I could
tell by his having changed his jacket so often, for bugs shed
their skins, you know. No, there was no reason that he
should have bred; it might have been a single gentleman or
an old maid.</p>

<p>“A married couple of bugs will lay from forty to fifty eggs
at one laying. The eggs are oval, and are each as large as
the thirty-second part of an inch; and when together are
in the shape of a caraway comfit, and of a bluish-white
color. They’ll lay this quantity of eggs three times in a
season. The young ones are hatched direct from the egg,
and, like young partridges, will often carry the broken eggs
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_274" title="274"></a><!--275.png-->
about with them, clinging to their back. They get their
fore-quarters out, and then they run about before the other
legs are completely cleared.</p>

<p>“As soon as the bugs are born they are of a cream color,
and will take to blood directly; indeed, if they don’t get it
in two or three days, they die; but after one feed they will
live a considerable time without a second meal. I have
known old bugs to be frozen over in a horse-pond&mdash;when
the furniture had been thrown in the water&mdash;and there they
have remained for a good three weeks; still, after they have
got a little bit warm in the sun’s rays, they have returned to
life again.</p>

<p>“I myself kept bugs for five years and a half without
food, and a housekeeper at Lord H&mdash;&mdash;’s informed me
that an old bedstead that I was then moving from a store-room
was taken down forty-five years ago, and had not been
used since, but the bugs in it were still numerous, though as
thin as living skeletons. They couldn’t have lived upon the
sap of the wood, it being worm-eaten and dry as a bone. A
bug will live for a number of years, and we find that when
bugs are put away in old furniture without food, they don’t
increase in number; so that, according to my belief, the bugs
I just mentioned must have existed forty-five years: besides,
they were large ones, and very dark colored, which is another
proof of age.</p>

<p>“It is a dangerous thing for bugs when they are shedding
their skins, which they do about four times in the course of
a year; when they throw off their hard shell and have a
soft coat, so that the least touch will kill them; whereas at
other times they will take a strong pressure. I have plenty
of bug-skins, which I keep by me as curiosities, of all sizes
and colors, and sometimes I have found the young bugs
collected inside the old ones’ skins for warmth, as if they had
put on their father’s great-coat. There are white bugs&mdash;albinoes
you may call ’em&mdash;freaks of nature like.”<a id="Marker_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="marker">925</a></p>

<h3 id="Notonectidae_Water-boatmen">Notonectidæ&mdash;Water-boatmen.</h3>

<p>Humboldt mentions that he saw insects’ eggs sold in the
markets of Mexico, which were collected on the surface of
lakes. Under the name of <i>Axayacat</i>, these eggs, or those
of some other species of fly, deposited on rush mats, are
sold as a caviare in Mexico. Rev. Thomas Smith, who
makes the same statement, also says the Mexicans likewise
eat the flies themselves, ground and made up with saltpetre.
Something similar to these eggs, found in the pools of the
desert of Fezzan, serves the Arabs for food, having the taste
of caviare.</p>

<p>In the Bulletin de la Société Impériale Zoologique d’Acclimation,
M. Guerin Méneville has published a paper on a
sort of bread which the Mexicans make of the eggs of
three species of heteropterous insects.</p>

<p>According to M. Craveri, by whom some of the Mexican
bread, and of the insects yielding it, were brought to Europe,
these insects and their eggs are very common in the fresh
waters of the lagunes of Mexico. The natives cultivate, in
the lagune of Chalco, a sort of carex called touté, on which
the insects readily deposit their eggs. Numerous bundles
of these plants are made, which are taken to a lagune, the
Texcuco, where they float in great numbers in the water.
The insects soon come and deposit their eggs on the plants,
and in about a month the bundles are removed from the
water, dried, and then beaten over a large cloth to separate
the myriad of eggs with which the insects have covered
them. These eggs are then cleaned and sifted, put into
sacks like flour, and sold to the people for making a sort
of cake or biscuit called “hautlé,” which forms a tolerably
good food, but has a fishy taste, and is slightly acid. The
bundles of carex are replaced in the lake, and afford a fresh
supply of eggs, which process may be repeated for an indefinite
number of times.</p>

<p>It appears that these insects have been used from an
early period, for Thomas Gage, a religionist, who sailed to
Mexico in 1625, says, in speaking of articles sold in the
markets, that they had cakes made of a sort of scum collected
from the lakes of Mexico, and that this was also sold
in other towns.</p>

<p>Brantz Mayer, in his Mexico as it was and as it is, 1844,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_276" title="276"></a><!--277.png-->
says: “On the lake of Texcuco I saw men occupied in collecting
the eggs of flies from the surface of plants, and
cloths arranged in long rows as places of resort for the
insects. These eggs, called <i>agayacath</i>, formed a favorite
food of the Indians long before the conquest; and when
made into cakes, resemble the roe of fish, having a similar
taste and appearance. After the use of frogs in France,
and birds’-nests in China, I think these eggs may be considered
a delicacy, and I found that they are not rejected
from the tables of the fashionable inhabitants of the
capital.”</p>

<p>The more recent observations of MM. Saussure, Sallé,
Virlet d’Aoust, etc. have confirmed the facts already stated,
at least in the most essential particulars.</p>

<p>“The insects which principally produce this animal farinha
of Mexico,” says a writer in the Journal de Pharmacie, “are
two species of the genus <i>Corixa</i> of Geoffroy, hemipterous
(heteropterous) insects of the family of water-bugs. One
of the species has been described by M. Guerin Méneville as
new, and has been named by him <i>Corixa femorata:</i> the
other, identified in 1831 by Thomas Say as one of those sold
in the market at Mexico, bears the name of <i>Corixa mercenaria</i>.
The eggs of these two species are attached in innumerable
quantities to the triangular leaves of the carex
forming the bundles which are deposited in the waters.
They are of an oval form with a protuberance at one end
and a pedicle at the other extremity, by means of which
they are fixed to a small round disk, which the mother
cements to the leaf. Among these eggs, which are grouped
closely together, there are found others, which are larger, of
a long and cylindrical form, and which are fixed to the
same leaves. These belong to another larger insect, a
species of <i>Notonecta</i>, which M. Guerin Méneville has named
<i>Notonecta unifasciata</i>.”</p>

<p>It appears from M. Virlet d’Aoust, that in October the
lakes of Chalco and Texcuco, which border on the City of
Mexico, are haunted by millions of “small flies,” which, after
dancing in the air, plunge down into the water, to the depth
of several feet, and deposit their eggs at the bottom.</p>

<p>“The eggs of these insects are called hautle (haoutle) by
the Mexican Indians, who collect them in great numbers,
and with whom they appear to be a favorite article of food.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_277" title="277"></a><!--278.png-->
They are prepared in various ways, but usually made into
cakes, which are eaten with a sauce flavored with chillies.”<a id="Marker_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="marker">926</a></p>

<p>Rev. Thomas Smith enumerates the following insects as
eaten by the ancient Mexicans: The <i>Atelepitz</i>, “a marsh
beetle, resembling in shape and size the flying beetles, having
four (?) feet, and covered with a hard shell.” The <i>Atopinan</i>,
“a marsh grasshopper of a dark color and great size,
being no less than six inches long and two broad.”(!) The
<i>Ahuihuitla</i>, “a worm which inhabits the Mexican lakes, four
inches long, and of the thickness of a goose quill, of a
tawny color on the upper part of the body, and white upon
the under part; it stings with its tail, which is hard and
poisonous.” And the <i>Ocuiliztac</i>, “a black marsh worm,
which becomes white on being roasted.”<a id="Marker_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="marker">927</a></p>

<h3 id="Culicidae_Gnats">Culicidæ&mdash;Gnats.<a id="Marker_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="marker">928</a></h3>

<p>Concerning the generation of Gnats, Moufet says:
“Countrey people suppose them, and that not improbably,
to be procreated from some corrupt moisture of the earth.”<a id="Marker_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="marker">929</a></p>

<p>A battle of Gnats (probably an appearance of Ephemera)
is recorded in Stow’s Chronicles of England, p. 509, to have
been fought in the reign of King Richard II.: “A fighting
among Gnats at the King’s maner of <i>Shine</i>, where they were
so thicke gathered, that the aire was darkened with them:
they fought and made a great battaile. Two partes of them
being slayne, fel downe to the grounde; the thirde parte
hauing got the victorie, flew away, no man knew whither.
The number of the deade was such that they might be
swept uppe with besomes, and bushels filled weyth them.”<a id="Marker_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="marker">930</a></p>

<p>In the year 1736 the Gnats, <i>Culex pipiens</i>, were so
numerous in England, that, as it is recorded, vast columns
of them were seen to rise in the air from the steeple of the
cathedral at Salisbury, which, at a little distance resembling
columns of smoke, occasioned many people to think the edifice
was on fire.<a id="Marker_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="marker">931</a> At Sagan, in Silesia, in July, 1812, a
similar occurrence gave rise in like manner to an alarm
that the church was on fire.<a id="Marker_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="marker">932</a> In May of the following year
at Norwich, at about six o’clock in the evening, the inhabitants
of that city were alarmed by the appearance of smoke
issuing from the upper window of the spire of the cathedral,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_279" title="279"></a><!--280.png-->
for which at the time no satisfactory account could be given,
but which was most probably produced by the same cause.<a id="Marker_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="marker">933</a>
And in the year 1766, in the month of August, they appeared
in such incredible numbers at Oxford as to resemble
a black cloud, darkening the air and almost intercepting
the rays of the sun. Mr. John Swinton mentions, that in
the evening of the 20th, about half an hour before sunset,
he was in the garden of Wadham College, when he saw six
columns of these insects ascending from the tops of six
boughs of an apple-tree, two in a perpendicular, three in an
oblique direction, and one in a pyramidal form, to the height
of fifty or sixty feet. Their bite was so envenomed, that
it was attended by violent and alarming inflammation; and
one when killed usually contained as much blood as would
cover three or four square inches of wall.<a id="Marker_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="marker">934</a> A similar column,
of two or three feet in diameter and about twenty feet in
height, was seen at eight o’clock in the evening of Sunday,
July 14th, 1833, in Kensington Gardens. The upper portion
of the column being curved to the east, the whole resembled
the letter J inverted. The Gnats in every part of
the column were in the liveliest motion.<a id="Marker_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="marker">935</a> The author of the
“Faerie Queene” seems to have witnessed the like curious
phenomenon, which furnished him with the following beautiful
simile:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">As when a swarme of gnats at eventide</div>
<div class="line">Out of the fennes of Allan doe arise,</div>
<div class="line">Their murmuring small trumpets sownden wide,</div>
<div class="line">Whiles in the air their clust’ring army flies,</div>
<div class="line">That as a cloud doth seem to dim the skies;</div>
<div class="line">Ne man nor beast may rest or take repast,</div>
<div class="line">For their sharp wounds and noyous injuries,</div>
<div class="line">Till the fierce northern wind with blust’ring blast</div>
<div class="line">Doth blow them quite away, and in the ocean cast.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ligon, in his History of Barbados, makes the following
curious observation relative to a species of insects which he
calls “Flyes,” but which are more probably Gnats or Mosquitoes:
“There is not only a race of all these kinds, that
go in a generation, but upon new occasions, new kinds; as,
after a great downfall of rain, when the ground has been
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_280" title="280"></a><!--281.png-->
extremely moistened, and softened with the water, I have
walk’d out upon a dry walk (which I made my self) in an
evening, and there came about me an army of such Flyes,
as I had never seen before, nor after; and they rose, as I
conceived, out of the earth: They were as big bodied as
Bees, but far larger wings, harm they did us none, but only
lighted on us; their colour between ash-colour and purple.”<a id="Marker_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="marker">936</a></p>

<p>If Gnats swarm in the summer in globular masses, it is
supposed to prognosticate a storm. Moufet says: “If
Gnats near sunset do play up and down in open air, they
presage heat; if in the shade, warm and milde showers;
but if they altogether sting those that passe by them, then
expect cold weather and very much rain.… If any one
would finde water either in a hill or valley, let him observe
(saith Paxanus in Geoponika) the sun rising, and where
the Gnats whirle round in form of an obelisk, underneath
there is water to be found. Yea, if Apomasaris deceive us
not, dreams of Gnats do foretell news of war or a disease,
and that so much the more dangerous as it shall be apprehended
to approach the more principall parts of the body.”<a id="Marker_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="marker">937</a></p>

<p>“On the 14th of December, 1830, at Oremburg, snow fell
accompanied by a multitude of small black Gnats, whose
motions were similar to those of a flea.” This singular
phenomenon was described at the session of the Academy
of St. Petersburg, held February 21st, 1831.<a id="Marker_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="marker">938</a></p>

<p>The pertinacity of the <i>Culicidæ</i> frequently renders them
a most formidable pest. Humboldt tells us “that between
the little harbor of Higuerote and the mouth of the Rio
Unare, the wretched inhabitants are accustomed to stretch
themselves on the ground, and pass the night buried in the
sand three or four inches deep, exposing only the head,
which they cover with a handkerchief.”<a id="Marker_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="marker">939</a> As another proof
of the terrible state to which man is sometimes reduced by
Mosquitoes, Captain Stedman relates that in one of his
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_281" title="281"></a><!--282.png-->
dreadful marches, the clouds of them were such, that the
soldiers dug holes with their bayonets in the earth, into
which they thrust their heads, stopping the entry and covering
their necks with their hammocks, while they lay with
their bellies on the ground: to sleep in any other position
was absolutely impossible. He himself, by a negro’s advice,
climbed to the top of the highest tree he could find,
and there slung his hammock among the boughs, and slept
exalted nearly a hundred feet above his companions,
“whom,” says he, “I could not see for the myriads of mosquitoes
below me, nor even hear, from the incessant buzzing
of these troublesome insects.”<a id="Marker_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="marker">940</a></p>

<p>“The Gnats in America,” says Moufet, “do so plash and
cut, that they will pierce through very thick clothing; so
that it is excellent sport to behold how ridiculously the barbarous
people, when they are bitten, will skip and frisk, and
slap with their hands their thighs, buttocks, shoulders, arms,
and sides, even as a carter doth his horses.”<a id="Marker_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="marker">941</a> Isaac Weld
tells us that “these insects were so powerful and bloodthirsty
that they actually pierced through General Washington’s
boots.”<a id="Marker_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="marker">942</a> They probably crept within the boots,
but the story is not incredible if we believe Moufet. This
naturalist says: “In Italy, near the Po, great store and
very great ones are to be seen, terrible for biting, and venomous,
piercing through a thrice-doubled stocking, and
boots likewise (<i>morsu crudeles et venenati, triplices caligas,
imo ocreas, item perforantes</i>), sometimes leaving behind
them impoysoned, hard, blue tumours, sometimes
painful bladders, sometimes itching pimples, such as Hippocrates
hath observed in his Epidemics, in the body of one
Cyrus, a fuller, being frantic.”<a id="Marker_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="marker">943</a></p>

<p>The poet Spenser, in his View of Ireland, says the Irish
“goe all naked except a mantle, which is a fit house for an
outlaw&mdash;a meet bed for a rebel&mdash;and an apt cloak for a
thiefe. It coucheth him strongly against the Gnats, which,
in that country, doe more to annoy the naked rebels, and
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_282" title="282"></a><!--283.png-->
doe more sharply wound them, than all their enemies’
swords and speares, which can seldom come nigh them.”</p>

<p>Stewart says that the negroes of Jamaica, who cannot
afford mosquito-nets, get into a mechanical habit of driving
away these troublesome nocturnal visitors, that even when
apparently wrapt in profound sleep, there is a continual
movement of the hands.<a id="Marker_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="marker">944</a></p>

<p>Herodotus says: “The means devised by the Egyptians
to avoid the Gnats, which swarm in prodigious numbers,
are these: Those who reside at some elevation above the
marshes, avail themselves of towers which they ascend to
sleep; for the Gnats, to avoid the winds, do not fly high.
While those who dwell on the very margins of the marshes,
instead of towers, practise another contrivance. Every man
possesses a net, which, during the day, he employs in catching
fish, and which at night he uses as his bed-chamber,
where he places it over his couch, and so sleeps within it.
For if any one,” he concludes, “sleeps wrapped in a cloak
or cloth, the Gnats will bite him through it; but they never
attempt to penetrate the net.”<a id="Marker_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="marker">945</a> With regard to the conclusion
of Herodotus, that nets with meshes will effectually
exclude Gnats, Tennent says he has “been satisfied by
painful experience that (if the theory be not altogether
fallacious) at least the modern mosquitoes of Ceylon are
uninfluenced by the same considerations which restrained
those of the Nile under the successors of Cambyses.”<a id="Marker_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="marker">946</a></p>

<p>Jackson complains that after a fifty-miles journey in
Africa, the Gnats would not suffer him to rest, and that his
hands and face appeared, from their bites, as if he was infected
with the small-pox in its worst stage.<a id="Marker_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="marker">947</a> Dr. Clarke
relates that in the neighborhood of the Crimea, the Russian
soldiers are obliged to sleep in sacks to defend themselves
from the mosquitoes; and even this, he adds, is not a sufficient
security, for several of them die in consequence of
mortification produced by these furious blood-suckers.<a id="Marker_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="marker">948</a></p>

<p>When we consider these circumstances, it is not incredible
that the army of Julian the Apostate should be so
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_283" title="283"></a><!--284.png-->
fiercely attacked by these insects as to be driven back; or
that the inhabitants of various cities, as Mouffet has collected
from different authors,<a id="Marker_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="marker">949</a> should, by an extraordinary
multiplication of this plague, have been compelled to desert
them. Also the latter part of the following story, related
by Theodoret, seems entitled to belief: When Sapor, King
of Persia, says this historian, was besieging the Roman
City of Nisibis in the year 360, James, Bishop of that city,
ascended one of the towers, and “prayed that Flies and
Gnats might be sent against the Persian hosts, that so they
might learn from these small insects the great power of
Him who protected the Romans.” Scarcely had the
Bishop concluded his prayer, continues Theodoret, when
swarms of Flies and Gnats appeared like clouds, so that
the trunks of the elephants were filled with them, as also
were the ears and nostrils of the horses and of the other
beasts of burden; and that, not being able to get rid of
these insects, the elephants and horses threw their riders,
broke the ranks, left the army, and fled away with the utmost
speed; and this, he concludes, compelled the Persians
to raise the siege.<a id="Marker_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="marker">950</a></p>

<p>“As the Cossacks of the Black Sea are no agriculturists,”
says Jaeger, “but derive their subsistence from their numerous
herds of horses, oxen, sheep, goats, and hogs, they suffer
immensely, at times, from the ravages of the mosquitoes.
Although they are fortunately not seen every year, these
blood-suckers may be considered a real Egyptian plague
among the herds of these Cossacks; for they soon transform
the most delightful plains into a mournful, solitary
desert, killing all the beasts, and completely stripping the
fields of every animated creature. One thousand of these
insatiate tormentors enter the nostrils, ears, eyes, and mouth
of the cattle, who shortly after die in convulsions, or from
secondary inflammation, or from absolute suffocation. In
the small town of Elizabethpol alone, during the month
of June, thirty horses, forty foals, seventy oxen, ninety
calves, a hundred and fifty hogs, and four hundred sheep
were killed by these flies.”<a id="Marker_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="marker">951</a></p>

<p>Ammianus Marcellinus, in his Roman History, treating
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_284" title="284"></a><!--285.png-->
of the wild beasts in Mesopotamia, gives us the following
curious zoological theory on the destruction of lions by
mosquitoes:</p>

<p>“The lions wander in countless droves among the beds
of rushes on the banks of the rivers of Mesopotamia, and in
the jungles, and lie quiet all the winter, which is very mild
in that country. But when the warm weather returns, as
these regions are exposed to great heat, they are forced out
by the vapours, and by the size of the Gnats, with swarms
of which every part of that country is filled. And these
winged insects attack the eyes, as being both moist and
sparkling, sitting on and biting the eyelids; the lions, unable
to bear the torture, are either drowned in the rivers, to
which they flee for refuge, or else, by frequent scratchings,
tear their eyes out themselves with their claws, and then
become mad. And if this did not happen, the whole of the
East would be overrun with beasts of this kind.”<a id="Marker_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="marker">952</a></p>

<p>I have never heard of mosquitoes being turned to any
good account save in California; and there, it seems, according
to Rev. Walter Colton, they are sometimes made
the ministers of justice. A rogue had stolen a bag of gold
from a digger in the mines, and hid it. Neither threats nor
persuasions could induce him to reveal the place of its concealment.
He was at last sentenced to a hundred lashes,
and then informed that he would be let off with thirty, provided
he would tell what he had done with the gold; but
he refused. The thirty lashes were administered, but he
was still stubborn as a mule. He was then stripped naked,
and tied to a tree. The mosquitoes with their long bills
went at him, and in less than three hours he was covered
with blood. Writhing and trembling from head to foot
with exquisite torture, he exclaimed, “Untie me, untie me,
and I will tell where it is.” “Tell first,” was the reply. So
he told where it might be found. Then some of the party
with wisps kept off the still hungry mosquitoes, while
others went where the culprit directed, and recovered the
bag of gold. He was then untied, washed with cold water,
and helped to his clothes, while he muttered, as if talking to
himself, “I couldn’t stand that anyhow.”<a id="Marker_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="marker">953</a></p>

<p>The largest kind of mosquito in the valley of the lower
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_285" title="285"></a><!--286.png-->
Mississippi is called the “Gallinipper.” It is peculiarly
described, by the boatmen, to be as large as a goose, and
that it flies about at night with a brickbat under its wings
with which it sharpens its “sting.”</p>

<p>They tell a good story to show the superiority of the
Gallinipper, over the ordinary Mosquito, in this wise.
Some fellow made a bet that, for a certain length of time,
he could stand the stings of the mosquitoes inflicted upon
his bare back while he lay on his face. He stripped himself
for the ordeal, and was bearing it manfully, when some mischievous
spectator threw a live coal of fire on him. He
winced, and, looking up by way of protest, exclaimed, “I
bar (debar) the Gallinipper.”</p>

<p>The Culicidæ, say Kirby and Spence, like other conquerors
who have been the torment of the human race,
have attained to fame, and have given their names to bays,
towns, and even to considerable territories; and instance
Mosquito Bay in St. Christopher’s; Mosquito, a town in
the Island of Cuba; and the Mosquito Shore of Central
America.<a id="Marker_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="marker">954</a></p>

<p>Democritus says: “Horse-hair, stretched through the
door, and through the middle of the house, destroys
Gnats.”<a id="Marker_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="marker">955</a></p>

<p>St. Macarius, Alban Butler says, was a confectioner of
Alexandria, who, in the flower of his age, spent upwards of
sixty years in the deserts in labor, penance, and contemplation.
“Our Saint,” continues Butler, “happened one day to
inadvertently kill a Gnat that was biting him in his cell;
reflecting that he had lost the opportunity of suffering that
mortification, he hastened from the cell for the marshes of
Scete, which abound with great flies, whose stings pierce
even wild boars. There he continued six months, exposed
to those ravaging insects; and to such a degree was his
whole body disfigured by them with sores and swellings,
that when he returned he was only to be known by his
voice.”<a id="Marker_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="marker">956</a></p>

<p>In the old English translation of the Bible, the observation
of our Saviour to the Pharisees, “Ye blind guides,
which strain <i>at</i> a Gnat, and swallow a camel,” is rendered
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_286" title="286"></a><!--287.png-->
“which strain <i>out</i> a Gnat,” and Bishop Pearce observes
that this is conformable to the sense of the passage. An
allusion is made to the custom which prevailed in Oriental
countries of passing their wine and other liquors through a
strainer, that no Gnats or flies might get into the cup. In
the Fragments to Calmet, we are informed that there is a
modern Arabic proverb to this effect, “He swallowed an
elephant, but was strangled by a fly.”<a id="Marker_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="marker">957</a></p>


<h3 id="Tipulidae_Crane-flies">Tipulidæ&mdash;Crane-flies.</h3>

<p>The larvæ of a species of Agaric-Gnat (<i>Mycetophila</i>)
live in society, and emigrate in files in a very soldier-like
manner. First goes one, next follow two, then three, etc.,
so as to exhibit a singular serpentine appearance. The
common people of Germany call this file <i>heerwurm</i>, and,
it is said, view them with great dread, regarding them as
ominous of war.<a id="Marker_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="marker">958</a></p>

<p>Maupertuis, in describing his ascent to Mount Pulinga,
in Lapland, says: “They had to fell a whole wood of large
trees, and the Flies (most probably <i>Tipulidæ</i>) attack’d ’em
with that fury, that the very soldiers, tho’ harden’d to the
greatest fatigues, were obliged to rap up their faces, or
cover them with tar. These insects poison’d their victuals,
for no sooner was a dish serv’d, but it was quite covered
with them.”<a id="Marker_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="marker">959</a> Maupertuis, in another place, says: “These
Flies make Lapland less tolerable in the summer than the
cold does in the winter.”<a id="Marker_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="marker">960</a> The severity with which the
Tipulidæ torment the Laplanders is attested also by Acerby,<a id="Marker_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="marker">961</a>
Linnæus,<a id="Marker_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="marker">962</a> De Geer,<a id="Marker_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="marker">963</a> and Reaumur.<a id="Marker_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="marker">964</a></p>

<h3 id="Muscidae_Flies">Muscidæ&mdash;Flies.</h3>

<p>Among the instances recorded of Flies appearing in immense
numbers, the following are the most remarkable:</p>

<p>“When the Creole frigate was lying in the outer roads
of Buenos Ayres, in 1819, at a distance of six miles from
the land, her decks and rigging were suddenly covered with
thousands of Flies and grains of sand. The sides of the
vessel had just received a fresh coat of paint, to which the
insects adhered in such numbers as to spot and disfigure
the vessel, and to render it necessary partially to renew the
paint. Capt. W.&nbsp;H. Smyth was obliged to repaint his vessel,
the Adventure, in the Mediterranean, from the same
cause. He was on his way from Malta to Tripoli, when a
southern wind blowing from the coast of Africa, then one
hundred miles distant, drove such myriads of Flies upon the
fresh paint that not the smallest point was left unoccupied
by the insects.”<a id="Marker_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="marker">965</a></p>

<p>“In May, 1699, at Kerton,” records Mrs. Thoresby, p. 15,
“in Lincolnshire, the sky seemed to darken north-westward
at a little distance from the town, as though it had been a
shower of hailstones or snow; but when it came near the
town, it appeared to be a prodigious swarm of Flies, which
went with such a force toward the south-east that persons
were forced to turn their backs of them.”<a id="Marker_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="marker">966</a></p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th of September, 1831, a small
dipterous insect, belonging to Meigen’s genus <i>Chlorops</i>,
and nearly allied to, if not identical with, his <i>C. læta</i>, appeared
suddenly, and in such immense quantities, in one of
the upper rooms of the Provost’s Lodge, in King’s College,
Cambridge, that the greater part of the ceiling toward the
window of the room was so thickly covered as not to be
visible. They entered by a window looking due north,
while the wind was blowing steadily N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. So it appears
they came from the direction of the River Cam, or
rather came with its current.<a id="Marker_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="marker">967</a></p>

<p>In the summer of 1834, which season was remarkable in
England for its swarms and shoals of insects, the air was
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_288" title="288"></a><!--289.png-->
constantly filled, says a writer in The Mirror, with millions
of small delicate Flies, and the sea in many places, particularly
on the Norfolk coasts, was perfectly blackened by the
amazing shoals. The length of these masses was not determined;
but they were, it is asserted, at least a league
broad. It is said the oldest fishermen of those seas never
remembered having seen or heard of such a phenomenon.<a id="Marker_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="marker">968</a></p>

<p>Capt. Dampier calls the natives of New Holland the
“poor winking people of New Holland,” and concludes his
description of them with the following observations: “Their
eyelids are always half closed, to keep the Flies out of their
eyes, they being so troublesome here that no fanning will
keep them from coming to one’s face; and without the assistance
of both hands to keep them off they will creep into
one’s nostrils, and mouth, too, if the lips are not shut very
close. So that from their infancy, being thus annoyed with
these insects, they do never open their eyes as other people,
and therefore they cannot see far, unless they hold up their
heads, as if they were looking at something over them.”<a id="Marker_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="marker">969</a></p>

<p>In a house at Zaffraan-craal, Dr. Sparrman suffered so
much from the common House-fly, <i>Musca domestica</i>,
which, in the south of Africa, frequently appears in such
prodigious numbers as to cover almost entirely the walls
and ceilings, that, as he asserts, it was impossible for him to
keep within doors for any length of time. To get rid of
these troublesome pests, the natives resort to a very ingenious
contrivance. It is thus related by the above-mentioned
traveler: “Bunches of herbs are hung up all over the
ceiling, on which the Flies settle in great numbers; a person
then takes a linen net or bag, of a considerable depth, fixed
to a long handle, and, inclosing in it every bunch, shakes it
about, so that the Flies fall down to the bottom of the
bag: when, after several applications of it in this manner,
they are killed by a pint or a quart at a time, by dipping
the bag into scalding hot water.”<a id="Marker_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="marker">970</a></p>

<p>Rhasis, Avicen, and Albertus say: “Bury the tail of a
wolf in the house, and the Flies will not come into it.”<a id="Marker_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="marker">971</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_289" title="289"></a><!--290.png-->

<p>Berytius says: “Flies will never rest on dumb animals if
they are rubbed with the fat of a lion.”<a id="Marker_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="marker">972</a></p>

<p>Pliny says: “At Rome yee shall not have a Flie or dog
that will enter into the chappell of Hercules standing in the
beast market.”<a id="Marker_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="marker">973</a></p>

<p>Plutarch, in the Eighth Book of his Symposiaques, learnedly
discourses upon the tamableness of the Fly. His opinion
is that it cannot be tamed.<a id="Marker_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="marker">974</a></p>

<p>Moufet, in his Theater of Insects, says: “Many ways
doth nature also by Flies play with the fancies of men in
dreams, if we may credit Apomasaris in his Apotelesms.
For the Indians, Persians, and Ægyptians do teach, that
if Flies appear to us in our sleep, it doth signifie an herauld
at arms, or an approaching disease. If a general of an
army, or a chief commander, dream that at such or such a
place he should see a great company of Flies, in that very
place, wherever it shall be, there he shall be in anguish and
grief for his soldiers that are slain, his army routed, and the
victory lost. If a mean or ordinary man dream the like,
he shall fall into a violent fever, which likely may cost him
his life. If a man dream in his sleep that Flies went into
his mouth or nostrils, he is to expect with great sorrow and
grief imminent destruction from his enemies.”<a id="Marker_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="marker">975</a></p>

<p>In an English North country chap-book, entitled the
Royal Dream-book, we find: “To dream of Flies or other
vermin, denotes enemies of all sorts.”<a id="Marker_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="marker">976</a></p>

<p>“When we see,” says Hollingshed, “a great number of
Flies in a yeare, we naturallie iudge it like to be a great
plague.”<a id="Marker_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="marker">977</a></p>

<p>Among the deep-sea fishermen of Greenock (Scotland),
there is a most comical idea that if a Fly falls into a glass
from which any one has been drinking, or is about to drink,
it is considered a sure omen of good luck to the drinker,
and is always noticed as such by the company.<a id="Marker_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="marker">978</a> Has this
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_290" title="290"></a><!--291.png-->
any connection with our saying of “taking a glass with a
<i>fly</i> in it?”</p>

<p>If Flies die in great numbers in a house, it is believed by
the common people to be a sure sign of death to some one
in the family occupying it; if throughout the country, an
omen of general pestilence. It is positively asserted that
Flies always die before the breaking out of the cholera, and
believed that they die of this disease.</p>

<p>Moufet, in his Theater of Insects, says: “When the Flies
bite harder than ordinary, making at the face and eyes of
men, they foretell rain or wet weather, from whence Politian
hath it:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Thirsty for blood the Fly returns,</div>
<div class="line">And with his sting the skin he burns.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps before rain they are most hungry, and therefore,
to asswage their hunger, do more diligently seek after their
food. This also is to be observed, that a little before a
showre or a storme comes, the Flies descend from the upper
region of the air to the lowest, and do fly, as it were, on the
very surface of the earth. Moreover, if you see them very
busie about sweet-meats or unguents, you may know that it
will presently be a showre. But if they be in all places
many and numerous, and shall so continue long (if Alexander
Benedict and Johannes Damascenus say true), they
foretell a plague or pestilence, because so many of them
could not be bred of a little putrefaction of the air.”<a id="Marker_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="marker">979</a> Elsewhere
Moufet states: “Neither are Flies begotten of dung
only, but of any other filthy matter putrefied by heat in the
summer time, and after the same way spoken of before, as
Grapaldus and Lonicerus have very well noted.”<a id="Marker_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="marker">980</a></p>

<p>Willsford, in his Nature’s Secrets, p. 135, says: “Flies in
the spring or summer season, if they grow busier or blinder
than at other times, or that they are observed to shroud
themselves in warm places, expect then quickly to follow
either hail, cold storms of rain, or very much wet weather;
and if these little creatures are noted early in autumn to
repair into their winter quarters, it presages frosty mornings,
cold storms, with the approach of hoary winter.
Atomes of Flies swarming together, and sporting themselves
in the sunbeams, is a good omen of fair weather.”<a id="Marker_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="marker">981</a></p>

<p>In Gayton’s Pleasant Notes upon Don Quixot, 1654, p.
99, speaking of Sancho Panza’s having converted a cassock
into a wallet, our pleasant annotator observes: “It was serviceable,
after this greasie use, for nothing but to preach at
a carnivale or Shrove Tuesday, and to tosse Pancakes in
after the exercise; or else, if it could have been conveighed
thither, nothing more proper for a man that preaches the
Cook’s sermon at Oxford, when that plump society rides
upon their governour’s horses to fetch in the Enemie, the
Flie.” That there was such a custom at Oxford, let Peshall,
in his history of that city, be a voucher, who, speaking of
St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, p. 280, says: “To this Hospital
cooks from Oxford flocked, bringing in on Whitsun-week
the Fly.” Aubrey saw this ceremony performed in
1642. He adds: “On Michaelmas-day, they rode thither
again to carry the Fly away.”<a id="Marker_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="marker">982</a></p>

<p>Plutarch, in his disquisition on the Art of Discerning a
Flatterer from a Friend, makes the following curious comparison:
“The Gad-Flie (as they say) which useth to
plague bulles and oxen, setteth about their eares, and
so doth the tick deal by dogges: after the same manner,
flatterers take hold of ambitious mens eares, and possesse
them with praises; and being once set fast there, hardly
are they to be removed and chased away.”<a id="Marker_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="marker">983</a></p>

<p>Plautus twice compares envious and inquisitive persons
to Flies.<a id="Marker_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="marker">984</a></p>

<p>In a narrative of unheard-of Popish cruelties toward
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_292" title="292"></a><!--293.png-->
Protestants beyond Seas, printed in 1680, we find the insinuating
detectives of the Spanish Inquisition under the
name of Flies.<a id="Marker_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="marker">985</a></p>

<p>Flies are mentioned somewhere in Lyndwood as the emblem
of unclean thoughts.<a id="Marker_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="marker">986</a></p>

<p>Flies were driven away when a woman was in labor, for
fear she should bring forth a daughter.<a id="Marker_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="marker">987</a></p>

<p>Flies are found represented in the pottery of the ancient
Egyptians.<a id="Marker_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="marker">988</a></p>

<p>Flies (<i>Cuspi</i>) were sacrificed to the Sun by the ancient
Peruvians.<a id="Marker_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="marker">989</a></p>

<p>“To let a Flee (Fly) stick i’ the wa’” is, in Scotland,
not to speak on some particular topic, to pass it over without
remark.<a id="Marker_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="marker">990</a></p>

<p>“Certes, a strange thing it is of these Flies,” says Pliny,
“which are taken to be as senselesse and witlesse creatures,
yea, and of as little capacity and understanding as any other
whatsoever: and yet at the solemne games and plaies holden
every fifth yeare at Olympia, no sooner is the bull sacrificed
there to the Idoll or god of the Flies called Myiodes, but a
man shall see (a wonderful thing to tell) infinit thousand
of flies depart out of that territorie by flights, as it were
thick clouds.”<a id="Marker_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="marker">991</a></p>

<p>This Myiodes or Maagrus, the “Fly-catcher,” was the
name of a hero, invoked at Aliphera, at the festivals of
Athena, as the protector against Flies. It was also a surname
of Hercules.</p>

<p>The following rendering of the second verse of the first
chapter of the Second Book of Kings, by Josephus, contains
an allusion to the worship of Baalzebub under the form of
a Fly: “Now it happened that <i>Ahaziah</i>, as he was coming
down from the top of his house, fell down from it, and in his
sickness sent to the <i>Fly</i> (Baalzebub), which was the god of
<i>Ekron</i>, for that was this god’s name, to enquire about his
recovery.”<a id="Marker_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="marker">992</a></p>

<p>With reference to this worship, we read in Purchas’s
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_293" title="293"></a><!--294.png-->
Pilgrims: “At Accaron was worshipped <i>Baalzebub</i>, that
is, the Lord of the Flies, either of contempt of his idolatrie,
so called; or rather of the multitude of Flies, which attended
the multitude of his sacrifices, when from the sacrifices
at the Temple of Jerusalem, as some say, they were
wholly free: or for that hee was their Larder-god (as the
Roman <i>Hercules</i>) to drive away flies: or for that from a
forme of a Flie, in which he was worshipped.… But for
Beelzebub, he was their <i>Æsculapius</i> or Physicke god, as
appeareth by Ahaziah who sent to consult with him in his
sickness. And perhaps from this cause the blaspheming
Pharisies, rather applyed the name of this then any other
Idoll to our blessed Saviour (Math. x. 25) whom they saw
indeed to performe miraculous cures, which superstition
had conceived of <i>Baalzebub:</i> and if any thing were done
by that Idoll, it could by no other cause bee effected but by
the Devill, as tending (like the popish miracles) to the confirmation
of Idolatrie.”<a id="Marker_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="marker">993</a></p>

<p>This god of the Flies was so called, thinks Whiston, as
was Jove among the Greeks, from his supposed power over
Flies, in driving them away from the flesh of their sacrifices,
which otherwise would have been very troublesome to
them.<a id="Marker_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="marker">994</a></p>

<p>It has been conjectured that the Fly, under which Baalzebub
was represented, was the Tumble-bug, <i>Scarabæus
pilluarius;</i> in which case, says Dr. Smith, Baalzebub and
Beelzebub might be used indifferently.<a id="Marker_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="marker">995</a></p>

<p>“Urspergensis saith that the Devil did very frequently
appear in the form of a Fly; whence it was that some of
the heathens called their familiar spirit <i>Musca</i> or Fly: perchance
alluding to that of Plautus:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Hic pol musca est, mi pater,</div>
<div class="line">Sive profanum, sive publicum, nil clam illum haberi potest:</div>

<p>This man, O my father, is a Fly, nothing can be concealed
from him, be it secret or publick, he is presently there, and
knowes all the matter.”<a id="Marker_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="marker">996</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_294" title="294"></a><!--295.png-->

<p>Loke, the deceiver of the gods, is fabled in the Northern
Mythology, to have metamorphosed himself into a Fly:
and demons, in the shape of Flies, were kept imprisoned
by the Finlanders, to be let loose on men and beasts.<a id="Marker_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="marker">997</a></p>

<p>In Scotland, a tutelary Fly, believed immortal, presided
over a fountain in the county of Banff: and here also a
large blue Fly, resting on the bark of trees, was distinguished
as a witch.<a id="Marker_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="marker">998</a></p>

<p>Among the games and plays of the ancient Greeks was
the Χαλκη Μυῖα, or Brazen Fly:&mdash;a variety of blind-man’s-buff,
in which a boy having his eyes bound with a fillet,
went groping round, calling out, “I am seeking the Brazen
Fly.” His companions replied, “You may seek, but you
will not find it”&mdash;at the same time striking him with cords
made of the inner bark of the papyros; and thus they proceeded
till one of them was taken.<a id="Marker_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="marker">999</a></p>

<p>This is most probably an allusion to some species of Fly
of a bronze color which is most difficult to catch, as, for
instance, the little fly found in summer beneath arbors, apparently
standing motionless in the air.</p>

<p>Petrus Ramus tells us of an iron Fly, made by Regiomontanus,
a famous mathematician of Nuremberg, which,
at a feast, to which he had invited his familiar friends, flew
forth from his hand, and taking a round, returned to his
hand again, to the great astonishment of the beholders.
Du Bartas thus expresses this:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Once as this artist, more with mirth than meat,</div>
<div class="line">Feasted some friends whom he esteemed great,</div>
<div class="line">Forth from his hand an iron Fly flew out;</div>
<div class="line">Which having flown a perfect round-about,</div>
<div class="line">With weary wings return’d unto her master:</div>
<div class="line">And as judicious on his arm he plac’d her.</div>
<div class="line">O! wit divine, that in the narrow womb</div>
<div class="line">Of a small fly, could find sufficient room</div>
<div class="line">For all those springs, wheels, counterpoise and chains,</div>
<div class="line">Which stood instead of life, and blood, and veins!<a id="Marker_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="marker">1000</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We find also in a work bearing the title “Apologie pour
les Grands Homines Accusés de Magie,” that “Jean de
Montroyal presented to the Emperor Charles V. an iron
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_295" title="295"></a><!--296.png-->
Fly, which made a solemn circuit round its inventor’s head,
and then reposed from its fatigue on his arm.”&mdash;Probably
the same automaton, since Regiomontanus and Montroyal
are the same.</p>

<p>Such a Fly as the above is rather extraordinary, yet I
have something better to tell&mdash;still about a Fly.</p>

<p>Gervais, Chancellor to the Emperor Otho III., in his
book entitled “Otia Imperatoris,” informs us that “the sage
Virgilius, Bishop of Naples, made a brass Fly, which he
placed on one of the city gates, and that this mechanical
Fly, trained like a shepherd’s dog, prevented any other fly
entering Naples; so much so, that during eight years the
meat exposed for sale in the market was never once
tainted!”<a id="Marker_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="marker">1001</a></p>

<p>“Varro affirmeth,” says Pliny, “that the heads of Flies
applied fresh to the bald place, is a convenient medicine for
the said infirmity and defect. Some use in this case the
bloud of flies: others mingle their ashes with the ashes of
paper used in old time, or els of nuts; with this proportion,
that there be a third part only of the ashes of flies to the
rest, and herewith for ten days together rubb the bare
places where the hair is gone. Some there be againe, who
temper and incorporat togither the said ashes of Flies with
the juice of colewort and brest-milke: others take nothing
thereto but honey.”<a id="Marker_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="marker">1002</a></p>

<p>Mucianus, who was thrice consul, carried about him a
living Fly, says Pliny, wrapped in a piece of white linen,
and strongly asserted that to the use of this expedient he
owed his preservation from ophthalmia.<a id="Marker_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="marker">1003</a></p>

<p>Ferdinand Mendez Pinto says: “In our travels with the
ambassador of the King of Bramaa to the Calaminham, we
saw in a grot men of a sect of one of their Saints, named
Angemacur: these lived in deep holes, made in the mider
of the rock, according to the rule of their wretched order,
eating nothing but Flies, Ants, Scorpions, and Spiders,
with the juice of a certain herb, much like to sorrel.”<a id="Marker_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="marker">1004</a></p>

<p>Says Moufet, in his Theater of Insects: “Plutarch, in
his Artaxerxes, relates that it was a law amongst a certain
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_296" title="296"></a><!--297.png-->
people, that whosoever should be so bold as to laugh at and
deride their lawes and constitutions of state, was bound for
twenty daies together in an open chest naked, all besmeared
with honey and milk, and so became a prey to the Flies and
Bees, afterward when the days were expired he was put into
a woman’s habit and thrown headlong down a mountain.…
Of which kinde of punishment also Suidas makes mention
in his Epicurus. There was likewise for greater offenders,
a punishment of Boats, so called. For that he that was
convict of high treason, was clapt between two boats,
with his head, hands, and feet hanging out: for his drink he
had milk and honey powred down his throat, with which also
his head and hands were sprinkled, then being set against
the sun, he drew to him abundance of stinging Flies, and
within being full of their worms, he putrefied by little and
little, and so died. Which kinde of examples of severity as
the ancients shewed to the guilty and criminous offenders;
so on the other side the Spaniards in the Indies, used to
drive numbers of the innocents out of their houses, as the
custome is among them, naked, all bedawbed with honey,
and expose them in open air to the biting of most cruel
Flies.”<a id="Marker_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="marker">1005</a></p>

<p>Mr. Henry Mayhew, in that part of his interesting work
on London Labor and London Poor devoted to the London
Street-folk, has given us the narratives of several “Catch-’em-Alive”
sellers&mdash;a set of poor boys who sell prepared
papers for the purpose of catching Flies. He discovered, as
he relates, a colony of these “Catch-’em-alive” boys residing
in Pheasant-court, Gray’s-inn-lane. They were playing at
“pitch-and-toss” in the middle of the paved yard, and all
were very willing to give him their statements; indeed, the
only difficulty he had was in making his choice among the
youths.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” said one with teeth ribbed like celery, to him,
“I’ve been at it longer than him.”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, he ain’t been out this year with the papers,”
said another, who was hiding a handful of buttons behind
his back.</p>

<p>“He’s been at shoe-blacking, sir; I’m the only reg’lar
fly-boy,” shouted a third, eating a piece of bread as dirty as
London snow.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_297" title="297"></a><!--298.png-->

<p>A big lad with a dirty face, and hair like hemp, was the
first of the “catch-’em-alive” boys who gave him his account
of his trade. He was a swarthy featured boy, with a broad
nose like a negro’s, and on his temple was a big half-healed
scar, which he accounted for by saying that “he had been
runned over” by a cab, though, judging from the blackness
of one eye, it seemed to Mr. Mayhew to have been the result
of some street fight. He said:</p>

<p>“I’m an Irish boy, and nearly turned sixteen, and I’ve
been silling fly-papers for between eight and nine year. I
must have begun to sill them when they first come out.
Another boy first tould me of them, and he’d been silling
them about three weeks before me. He used to buy them
of a party as lives in a back-room near Drury-lane, what
buys paper and makes the catch ’em alive for himself.
When they first come out they used to charge sixpence a
dozen for ’em, but now they’ve got ’em to twopence ha’penny.
When I first took to silling ’em, there was a tidy lot of boys
at the business, but not so many as now, for all the boys
seem at it. In our court alone I should think there was
about twenty boys silling the things.</p>

<p>“At first, when there was a good time, we used to buy
three or four gross together, but now we don’t no more than
half a gross. As we go along the streets we call out different
cries. Some of us says, ‘Fly-papers, fly-papers,
ketch ’em all alive.’ Others make a kind of song of it,
singing out, ‘Fly-paper, ketch ’em all alive, the nasty flies,
tormenting the baby’s eyes. Who’d be fly-blow’d, by all the
nasty blue-bottles, beetles, and flies?’ People likes to buy
of a boy as sings out well, ’cos it makes ’em laugh.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I sell so many in town as I do in the borders
of the country, about Highbury, Croydon, and Brentford.
I’ve got some regular customers in town about the
City-prison and the Caledonian-road; and after I’ve served
them and the town custom begins to fall off, then I goes to
the country. We goes two of us together, and we takes
about three gross. We keep on silling before us all the
way, and we comes back the same road. Last year we
sould very well in Croydon, and it was the best place for
gitting the best price for them; they’d give a penny a piece
for ’em there, for they didn’t know nothing about them. I
went off one day at ten o’clock and didn’t come home till
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_298" title="298"></a><!--299.png-->
two in the morning. I sould eighteen dozen out in that
d’rection the other day, and got rid of them before I had
got half-way. But flies are very scarce at Croydon this year,
and we haven’t done so well. There ain’t half as many flies
this summer as last.</p>

<p>“Some people says the papers draws more flies than they
ketches, and that when one gets in, there’s twenty others will
come to see him. It’s according to the weather as the flies
is about. If we have a fine day it fetches them out, but a
cold day kills more than our papers.</p>

<p>“We sills the most papers to little cook-shops and sweet-meat
shops. We don’t sill so many at private houses. The
public-houses is pretty good customers, ’cos the beer draws
the flies. I sould nine dozen at one house&mdash;a school&mdash;at
Highgate, the other day. I sould ’em two for three-ha’
pence. That was a good hit, but then t’other days we loses.
If we can make a ha’penny each we thinks we does well.</p>

<p>“Those that sills their papers at three a-penny buys them
at St. Giles’s, and pays only three ha’pence a dozen for them,
but they ain’t half as big and good as those we pays tuppence-ha’penny
a dozen for.</p>

<p>“Barnet is a good place for fly-papers; there’s a good lot
of flies down there. There used to be a man at Barnet as
made ’em, but I can’t say if he do now. There’s another
at Brentford, so it ain’t much good going that way.</p>

<p>“In cold weather the papers keep pretty well, and will
last for months with just a little warming at the fire; for
they tears on opening when they are dry. You see we
always carry them with the stickey sides doubled up together
like a sheet of writing-paper. In hot weather, if you keep
them folded up, they lasts very well; but if you opens them,
they dry up. It’s easy opening them in hot weather, for
they comes apart as easy as peeling a horrange. We generally
carries the papers in a bundle on our arm, and we ties
a paper as is loaded with flies round our cap, just to show
the people the way to ketch ’em. We get a loaded paper
given to us at a shop.</p>

<p>“When the papers come out first, we use to do very well
with fly-papers; but now it’s hard work to make our own
money for ’em. Some days we used to make six shillings a
day regular. But then we usen’t to go out every day, but
take a rest at home. If we do well one day, then we might
stop idle another day, resting. You see, we had to do our
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_299" title="299"></a><!--300.png-->
twenty or thirty miles silling them to get that money, and
then the next day we was tired.</p>

<p>“The silling of papers is gradual falling off. I could go
out and sill twenty dozen wonst where I couldn’t sill one
now. I think I does a very grand day’s work if I yearns
a shilling. Perhaps some days I may lose by them. You
see, if it’s a very hot day, the papers gets dusty; and besides,
the stuff gets melted and oozes out; though that
don’t do much harm, ’cos we gets a bit of whitening and
rubs ’em over. Four years ago we might make ten shillings
a day at the papers, but now, taking from one end of the
fly-season to the other, which is about three months, I think
we makes about one shilling a day out of papers, though
even that ain’t quite certain. I never goes out without
getting rid of mine, somehow or another, but then I am
obleeged to walk quick and look about me.</p>

<p>“When it’s a bad time for silling the papers, such as a
wet, could day, then most of the fly-paper boys goes out with
brushes, cleaning boots. Most of the boys is now out hopping.
They goes reg’lar every year after the season is give
over for flies.</p>

<p>“The stuff as they puts on the paper is made out of boiled
oil and turpentine and resin. It’s seldom as a fly lives more
than five minutes after it gets on the paper, and then it’s as
dead as a house. The blue-bottles is tougher, but they don’t
last long, though they keeps on fizzing as if they was trying
to make a hole in the paper. The stuff is only p’isonous for
flies, though I never heard of anybody as ever eat a fly-paper.”</p>

<p>A second lad, in conclusion, said: “There’s lots of boys
going selling ‘ketch-’em-alive oh’s’ from Golden-lane, and
White-chapel and the Borough. There’s lots, too, comes
out of Gray’s-inn-lane and St. Giles’s. Near every boy who
has nothing to do goes out with fly-papers. Perhaps it ain’t
that the flies is falled off that we don’t sill so many papers
now, but because there’s so many boys at it.”</p>

<p>A third, of the lot the most intelligent and gentle in his
demeanor, though the smallest in stature, said:</p>

<p>“I’ve been longer at it than the last boy, though I’m only
getting on for thirteen, and he’s older than I’m; ’cos I’m
little and he’s big, getting a man. But I can sell them
quite as well as he can, and sometimes better, for I can
holler out just as loud, and I’ve got reg’lar places to go to. I
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_300" title="300"></a><!--301.png-->
was a very little fellow when I first went out with them, but
I could sell them pretty well then, sometimes three or four
dozen a day. I’ve got one place, in a stable, where I can
sell a dozen at a time to country people.</p>

<p>“I calls out in the streets, and I goes into the shops, too,
and calls out, ‘Ketch ’em alive, ketch ’em alive; ketch all
the nasty black-beetles, blue-bottles, and flies; ketch ’em
from teasing the baby’s eyes.’ That’s what most of us boys
cries out. Some boys who is stupid only says, ‘Ketch ’em
alive,’ but people don’t buy so well from them.</p>

<p>“Up in St. Giles’s there is a lot of fly-boys, but they’re a
bad set, and will fling mud at gentlemen, and some prigs the
gentlemen’s pockets. Sometimes, if I sell more than a big
boy, he’ll get mad and hit me. He’ll tell me to give him a
halfpenny and he won’t touch me, and that if I don’t he’ll
kill me. Some of the boys takes an open fly-paper, and
makes me look another way, and then they sticks the ketch-’em-alive
on my face. The stuff won’t come off without soap
and hot water, and it goes black, and looks like mud. One
day a boy had a broken fly-paper, and I was taking a drink
of water, and he come behind me and slapped it up in my face.
A gentleman as saw him give him a crack with a stick and
me twopence. It takes your breath away, until a man comes
and takes it off. It all sticked to my hair, and I couldn’t
rack (comb) right for some time.…</p>

<p>“I don’t like going along with other boys, they take your
customers away; for perhaps they’ll sell ’em at three a penny
to ’em, and spoil the customers for you. I won’t go with
the big boy you saw, ’cos he’s such a blackgeyard; when
he’s in the country he’ll go up to a lady and say, ‘Want a
fly-paper, marm?’ and if she says ‘No,’ he’ll perhaps job
his head in her face&mdash;butt at her like.</p>

<p>“When there’s no flies, and the ketch-’em-alive is out,
then I goes tumbling. I can turn a cat’enwheel over on
one hand. I’m going to-morrow to the country, harvesting
and hopping&mdash;for, as we says, ‘Go out hopping, come in jumping.’
We start at three o’clock to-morrow, and we shall
get about twelve o’clock at night at Dead Man’s Barn. It
was left for poor people to sleep in, and a man was buried
there in a corner. The man had got six farms of hops; and
if his son hadn’t buried him there, he wouldn’t have had
none of the riches.</p>

<p>“The greatest number of fly-papers I’ve sold in a day is
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_301" title="301"></a><!--302.png-->
about eight dozen. I never sells no more than that; I wish
I could. People won’t buy ’em now. When I’m at it I
makes, taking one day with another, about ten shillings a
week. You see, if I sold eight dozen, I’d make four shillings.
I sell ’em at a penny each, at two for three-ha’pence, and
three for twopence. When they gets stale I sells ’em for
three a penny. I always begin by asking a penny each, and
perhaps they’ll say, ‘Give me two for three ha’pence?’ I’ll
say, ‘Can’t, ma’am,’ and then they pulls out a purse full of
money and gives a penny.</p>

<p>“The police is very kind to us, and don’t interfere with
us. If they see another boy hitting us they’ll take off their
belts and hit ’em. Sometimes I’ve sold a ketch-’em-alive to
a policeman; he’ll fold it up and put it into his pocket to
take home with him. Perhaps he’s got a kid, and the flies
teazes its eyes.</p>

<p>“Some ladies like to buy fly-cages better than ketch-em-alive’s,
because sometimes when they’re putting ’em up they
falls in their faces, and then they screams.”</p>

<p>The history of the manufacture of Fly-papers was thus
given to Mr. Mayhew by a manufacturer, whom he found in
a small attic-room near Drury-lane: “The first man as was
the inventor of these fly-papers kept a barber’s shop in St.
Andrew-street, Seven Dials, of the name of Greenwood or
Greenfinch, I forget which. I expect he diskivered it by accident,
using varnish and stuff, for stale varnish has nearly
the same effect as our composition. He made ’em and sold
’em at first at threepence and fourpence a piece. Then it
got down to a penny. He sold the receipt to some other
parties, and then it got out through their having to employ
men to help ’em. I worked for a party as made ’em, and
then I set to work making ’em for myself, and afterwards
hawking them. They was a greater novelty then than they
are now, and sold pretty well. Then men in the streets,
who had nothing to do, used to ask me where I bought ’em,
and then I used to give ’em my own address, and they’d
come and find me.”<a id="Marker_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="marker">1006</a></p>

<h3 id="OEstridae_Bot-flies">Œstridæ&mdash;Bot-flies.</h3>

<p>The larvæ of Bots, <i>Œstris ovis</i>, found in the heads of
sheep and goats, have been prescribed, and that, from the tripod
of Delphos, as a remedy for the epilepsy. We are told
so on the authority of Alexander Trailien; but whether
Democritus, who consulted the oracle, was cured by this
remedy, does not appear; the story shows, however, that
the ancients were aware that these maggots made their way
even into the brain of living animals.<a id="Marker_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="marker">1007</a> The oracle answered
Democritus as follows:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Take a tame goat that hath the greatest head,</div>
<div class="line">Or else a wilde goat in the field that’s bred,</div>
<div class="line">And in his forehead a great worm you’l finde,</div>
<div class="line">This cures all diseases of that kinde.<a id="Marker_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="marker">1008</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The common saying that a whimsical person is <i>maggoty</i>,
or has got <i>maggots in his head</i>, perhaps arose from the
freaks the sheep have been observed to exhibit when infested
by their Bots.<a id="Marker_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="marker">1009</a></p>

<p>The following “charme for the Bots<a id="Marker_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="marker">1010</a> in a horse” is
found in Scots’ Discovery of Witchcraft, printed in 1651:
“You must both say and do thus upon the diseased horse
three days together, before the sun rising: <i>In nomine pa<span class="normal">†</span>tris
&amp; fi<span class="normal">†</span>lii &amp; Spiritus<span class="normal">†</span>sancti, Exorcize te vermen per
Deum pa<span class="normal">†</span>trem &amp; fi<span class="normal">†</span>lium &amp; Spiritum<span class="normal">†</span>sanctum:</i> that is, In
the name of God the father, the sonne, and the Holy Ghost,
I conjure thee O worm by God, the Father, the sonne, and
the Holy Ghost; that thou neither eate nor drink the flesh,
blood, or bones of this horse; and that thou hereby maiest
be made as patient as Job, and as good as S. John Baptist,
when he baptized Christ in Jordan, <i>In nomine pa<span class="normal">†</span>tris &amp;
fi<span class="normal">†</span>lii et spiritus<span class="normal">†</span>sancti</i>. And then say three <i>Pater nosters</i>,
and three <i>Aves</i>, in the right eare of the horse, to the glory
of the holy trinity. Do<span class="normal">†</span>minus fili<span class="normal">†</span>us spirit<span class="normal">†</span>us Mari<span class="normal">†</span>a.”<a id="Marker_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="marker">1011</a></p>

<p>There is a popular error in England respecting the <i>Œstrus
(Gasterophilus) equi (hæmorrhoidalis)</i>, which Shakspeare
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_303" title="303"></a><!--304.png-->
has followed, and which has been judiciously explained by
Mr. Clark. Shakspeare makes the carrier at Rochester
observe: “Peas and oats are as dank here as a dog, and
that’s the next way to give <i>poor jades the bots</i>.”<a id="Marker_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="marker">1012</a></p>

<p>The larvæ of this insect, says Mr. Clark, are mostly
known among the country people by the name of <i>wormals</i>,
<i>wormuls</i>, <i>warbles</i>, or, more properly, <i>Bots</i>. And our ancestors
erroneously imagined that poverty or improper food
engendered them in horses. The truth, however, seems
to be, that when the animal is kept without food the Bots
are also, and are then, without doubt, most troublesome;
whence it was very naturally supposed that poverty or bad
food was the parent of them.<a id="Marker_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="marker">1013</a></p>

<p>A cow with its hide perforated by Warbles, in England,
was said to be elf-shot: the holes being made by the arrows
of the little malignant fairies. In the Northern Antiquities,
p. 404, we find the following:</p>

<p>“If at such a time you were to look through an elf-bore
in wood, where a thorter knot has been taken out, or
through the hole made by an elf-arrow (which has probably
been made by a Warble) in the skin of a beast that has
been elf-shot, you may see the elf-bull naiging (butting)
with the strongest bull or ox in the herd; but you will
never see with that eye again.”</p>

<p>In the Scottish history of the trials of witches, we find
the following: Alexander Smaill offended Jonet Cock, who
threatened him, “deare sail yow rewe it! and within half
ane howre therafter, going to the pleugh,&mdash;befoir he had
gone one about, their came ane great Wasp or Bee, so that
the foir horses did runne away with the pleugh, and wer
liklie to have killed themselves, and the said Alexander
and the boy that was with him, narrowlie escaped with
their lyves.”<a id="Marker_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="marker">1014</a> Possibly the incident is not exaggerated, as
a single Œstrus will turn the oxen of a whole herd, and
render them furious.</p>


<hr />

<p>Spencer, in his Travels in Circassia, speaks of a poisonous
Fly, known in Hungary under the name of the Golubaeser-fly,
which is singularly destructive to cattle. The
Hungarian peasants, to account for the severity of the bite
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_304" title="304"></a><!--305.png-->
of this insect, tell us that in the caverns, near the Castle
of Golubaes, the renowned champion, St. George, killed
the dragon, and that its decomposed remains have continued
to generate these insects down to the present day.
So firmly did they believe this, that they closed up the
mouths of the caverns with stone walls.<a id="Marker_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="marker">1015</a></p>

<h3 id="Pulicidae_Fleas">Pulicidæ&mdash;Fleas.</h3>

<p>The name <i>Pulex</i>, given to the Flea by the Romans, is
stated by Isodorus to have been derived from <i>pulvis</i>, dust,
<i>quasi pulveris filius</i>. Our English name <i>Flea</i>, and the
German <i>Flock</i>, are evidently deduced from the quick motions
of this insect.</p>

<p>As to the origin of Fleas, Moufet had a similar notion to
that contained in the word Pulex, if we adopt the etymology
of Isodorus, for he says they are produced from the
dust, especially when moistened with urine, the smallest
ones springing from putrid matter. Scaliger relates that
they are produced from the moistened humors among the
hairs of dogs.<a id="Marker_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="marker">1016</a> Conformable to the curious notion of Moufet,
Shakspeare says:</p>


<div class="drama">
<p><span class="speaker">2 Car.</span> I think this be the most villainous house in all London
road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">1 Car.</span> Like a tench? by the mass, there is ne’er a king in Christendom
could be better bit than I have been since the first cock.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">2 Car.</span> Why, they will allow us ne’er a jorden, and then we leak
in your chimney; and your <i>chamber-ley breeds fleas</i> like a loach.<a id="Marker_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="marker">1017</a></p>
</div>

<p>“Martyr, the author of the Decads of Navigation, writes,
that in Perienna, a countrey of the Indies, the drops of
sweat that fall from their slaves’ bodies will presently turn
to Fleas.”<a id="Marker_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="marker">1018</a></p>

<p>Ewlin, in his book of Travels in Turkey, has recorded a
singular tradition of the history of the Flea and its confraternity,
as preserved among a sect of Kurds, who dwelt in
his time at the foot of Mount Sindshar. “When Noah’s
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_306" title="306"></a><!--307.png-->
Ark,” says the legend, “sprung a leak by striking against
a rock in the vicinity of Mount Sindshar, and Noah despaired
altogether of safety, the serpent promised to help
him out of his mishap if he would engage to feed him upon
human flesh after the deluge had subsided. Noah pledged
himself to do so; and the serpent coiling himself up, drove
his body into the fracture and stopped the leak. When the
pluvious element was appeased, and all were making their
way out of the ark, the serpent insisted upon the fulfillment
of the pledge he had received; but Noah, by Gabriel’s advice,
committed the pledge to the flames, and scattering its
ashes in the air, there arose out of them Fleas, Flies, Lice,
Bugs, and all such sort of vermin as prey upon human
blood, and after this fashion was Noah’s pledge redeemed.”<a id="Marker_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="marker">1019</a></p>

<p>The Sandwich Islanders have the following tradition in
regard to the introduction of Fleas into their country: Many
years ago a woman from Waimea went out to a ship to see her
lover, and as she was about to return, he gave her a bottle,
saying that there was very little valuable property (<i>waiwai</i>)
contained in it, but that she must not open it, on any account,
until she reached the shore. As soon as she gained
the beach, she eagerly uncorked the bottle to examine her
treasure, but nothing was to be discovered,&mdash;the Fleas
hopped out, and “they have gone on hopping and biting
ever since.”<a id="Marker_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="marker">1020</a></p>

<p>Our pigmy tormentor, <i>Pulex irritans</i>, in the opinion of
some, seems to have been regarded as an agreeable rather
than a repulsive object. “Dear Miss,” said a lively old
lady to a friend of Kirby and Spence (who had the misfortune
to be confined to her bed by a broken limb, and was
complaining that the Fleas tormented her), “don’t you like
<i>Fleas?</i> Well, I think they are the prettiest little merry
things in the world.&mdash;I never saw a dull Flea in all my life.”<a id="Marker_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="marker">1021</a>
Dr. Townson, as mentioned by the above writers, from the
encomium which he bestows upon these vigilant little vaulters,
as supplying the place of an alarum and driving us from the
bed of sloth, should seem to have regarded them with the
same happy feelings.<a id="Marker_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="marker">1022</a></p>

<p>When Ray and Willughby were traveling, they found “at
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_307" title="307"></a><!--308.png-->
Venice and Augsburg Fleas for sale, and at a small price
too, decorated with steel or silver collars around their necks,
of which Willughby purchased one. When they are kept in
a box amongst wool or cloth, in a warm place, and fed once
a day, they will live a long time. When they begin to suck
they erect themselves almost perpendicularly, thrusting their
sucker, which originates in the middle of the forehead, into
the skin. The itching is not felt immediately, but a little
afterwards. As soon as they are full of blood, they begin
to void a portion of it, and thus, if permitted, they will continue
for many hours sucking and voiding. After the first
itching no uneasiness is subsequently felt. Willughby’s
Flea lived for three months by sucking in this manner the
blood of his hand; it was at length killed by the cold of
winter.”<a id="Marker_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="marker">1023</a></p>

<p>We read in Purchas’s Pilgrims that a city of the Miantines
is said to have been dispeopled by Fleas;<a id="Marker_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="marker">1024</a> and Messrs.
Lewis and Clarke, who found these insects more tormenting
than all the other plagues of the Missouri country, say they
sometimes here compel even the natives to shift their quarters.<a id="Marker_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="marker">1025</a></p>

<p>Dr. Clarke was informed by an Arab Sheikh that “the
king of the Fleas held his court at Tiberias.”<a id="Marker_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="marker">1026</a></p>

<p>To prevent Fleas from breeding, Pliny gives the following
curious recipe: “Since I have made mention of the cuckow,”
says this writer, “there comes into my mind a strange and miraculous
matter that the said magicians report of this bird;
namely, that if a man, the first time that he heareth her to
sing, presently stay his right foot in the very place where it
was when he heard her, and withal mark out the point and
just proportion of the said foot upon the ground as it stood,
and then digg up the earth under it within the said compasse,
look what chamber or roume of the house is strewed with
the said mould, there will no Fleas bread there.”<a id="Marker_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="marker">1027</a></p>

<p>Thomas Hill, in his Naturall and Artificiall Conclusions,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_308" title="308"></a><!--309.png-->
printed 1650, quotes this passage from Pliny, calling it “A
very easie and merry conceit to keep off fleas from your beds
or chambers.”<a id="Marker_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="marker">1028</a></p>

<p>The Hungarian shepherds grease their linen with hogs’
lard, and thus render themselves so disgusting even to the
Fleas and Lice, as to put them effectually to flight.<a id="Marker_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="marker">1029</a></p>

<p>There is still shown in the Arsenal at Stockholm a diminutive
piece of ordnance, four or five inches in length, with
which, report says, on the authority of Linnæus, the celebrated
Queen Christiana used to cannonade Fleas.<a id="Marker_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="marker">1030</a></p>

<p>But, seriously, if you wish for an effectual remedy, that
prescribed by old Tusser, in his Points of Goode Husbandry,
in the following lines, will answer your purpose:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">While wormwood hath seed, get a handfull or twaine,</div>
<div class="line">To save against March, to make flea to refraine:</div>
<div class="line">Where chamber is sweeped and wormwood is strown,</div>
<div class="line">No flea for his life dare abide to be known.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The inhabitants of Dalecarlia place the skins of hares in
their apartments, in which the Fleas willingly take refuge,
so that they are easily destroyed by the immersion of the
skin in scalding water.<a id="Marker_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="marker">1031</a></p>

<p>Pamphilius among others gives the following remedies
against Fleas: If a person, he says, sets a dish in the middle
of the house, and draws a line around it with an iron
sword (it will be better if the sword has done execution),
and if he sprinkles the rest of the house, excepting the
place circumscribed, with an irrigation of staphisagria, or
of powdered leaves of the bay-tree, they having been boiled
in brine or in sea-water, he will bring all the Fleas together
into the dish. A jar also being set in the ground with its
edge even with the pavement, and smeared with bulls’ fat,
will attract all the Fleas, even those that are in the wardrobe.
If you enter a place where there are Fleas, express
the usual exclamation of distress, and they will not touch
you. Make a small trench under a bed, and pour goats’
blood into it, and it will bring all the Fleas together, and it
will allure those from your clothing. Fleas may be removed
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_309" title="309"></a><!--310.png-->
also, concludes this writer, from the most villous and from
the thickest pieces of tapestry, whither, they betake themselves
when full, if goats’ blood is set in a vessel or in a
cork.<a id="Marker_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="marker">1032</a></p>

<p>Moufet says: “A Gloeworm, set in the middle of the
house, drives away Fleas.”<a id="Marker_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="marker">1033</a></p>

<p>On the subject of destroying Fleas, the following pleasant
piece of satire, by Poor Humphrey, will be read with a
smile: “A notable projector became notable by one project
only, which was a certain specific for the killing of fleas, and
it was in form of a powder, and sold in papers, with plain directions
for use, as followeth: The flea was to be held conveniently
between the thumb and finger of the left hand;
and to the end of the trunk or proboscis, which protrudeth
in the flea, somewhat as the elephant’s doth, a very small
quantity of the powder was to be put from between the
thumb and finger of the right hand. And the deviser undertook,
if any flea to whom his powder was so administered
should prove to have afterwards bitten a purchaser who
used it, then that purchaser should have another paper of
the said powder gratis. And it chanced that the first paper
thereof was bought idly, as it were, by an old woman, and
she, without meaning to injure the inventor, or his remedy,
but, of her mere harmlessness, did innocently ask him,
whether, when she had caught the flea, and after she had
got it, as before described, if she should kill it with her
nail it would not be as well. Whereupon the ingenious inventor
was so astonished by the question, that, not knowing
what to answer on the sudden occasion, he said with truth
to this effect, that without doubt her way would do, too.
And according to the belief of Poor Humphrey, there is
not as yet any device more certain or better for destroying
a flea, when thou hast captured him, than the ancient manner
of the old woman’s, or instead thereof, the drowning of
him in fair water, if thou hast it by thee at the time.”<a id="Marker_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="marker">1034</a></p>

<p>The old English hunters report that foxes are full of Fleas,
and they tell the following queer story how they get rid of
them: “The fox,” say they, as recorded by Mouffet, “gathers
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_310" title="310"></a><!--311.png-->
some handfuls of wool from thorns and briars, and wrapping
it up, he holds it fast in his mouth, then goes by degrees
into a cold river, and dipping himself close by little and
little, when he finds that all the Fleas are crept so high as
his head for fear of drowning, and so for shelter crept into
the wool, he barks and spits out the wool, full of Fleas, and
so very froliquely being delivered from their molestation, he
swims to land.”<a id="Marker_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="marker">1035</a></p>

<p>Ramsay thus alludes to this story:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Then sure the lasses, and ilk gaping coof,</div>
<div class="line">Wad rin about him, and had out their loof.</div>
<div class="line"><i>M.</i> As fast as fleas skip to the tale of woo,</div>
<div class="line">Whilk slee Tod Lowrie (the fox) hads without his mow,</div>
<div class="line">When he to drown them, and his hips to cool,</div>
<div class="line">In summer days slides backward in a pool.<a id="Marker_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="marker">1036</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Preceding this story, Mouffet makes the following observations:
“The lesser, leaner, and younger they are, the sharper
they bite, the fat ones being more inclined to tickle and
play; and then are not the least plague, especially when in
greater numbers, since they molest men that are sleeping, and
trouble wearied and sick persons; from whom they escape by
skipping; for as soon as they find they are arraigned to die, and
feel the finger coming, on a sudden they are gone, and leap
here and there, and so escape the danger; but so soon as
day breaks, they forsake the bed. They then creep into the
rough blankets, or hide themselves in rushes and dust, lying
in ambush for pigeons, hens, and other birds, also for men
and dogs, moles and mice, and vex such as passe by.”<a id="Marker_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="marker">1037</a></p>

<p>It is frequently affirmed that asses are never troubled with
Fleas or other vermin; and, among the superstitious, it is
said that it is all owing to the riding of Christ upon one of
these animals.<a id="Marker_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="marker">1038</a></p>

<p>Willsford, in his Nature’s Secrets, printed 1658, p. 130,
says: “The little sable beast (called a <i>Flea</i>), if much thirsting
after blood, it argues rain.”<a id="Marker_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="marker">1039</a></p>

<p>It is related that the Devil, teasing St. Domingo in the
shape of a Flea, skipped upon his book, when the saint
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_311" title="311"></a><!--312.png-->
fixed him as a mark where he left off, and continued to use
him so through the volume.<a id="Marker_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="marker">1040</a></p>

<p>Fleas infesting beds were attributed to the envy of the
Devil.<a id="Marker_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="marker">1041</a></p>

<p>Giles Fletcher says that Iwan Yasilowich sent to the City
of Moscow to provide for him a measure full of Fleas for a
medicine. They answered that it was impossible, and if they
could get them, yet they could not measure them because of
their leaping out. Upon which he set a mulct upon the city
of seven thousand rubles.<a id="Marker_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="marker">1042</a></p>

<p>We read in Purchas’s Pilgrims that the Jews were not
permitted to burn Fleas in the flame of their lamps on Sabbath
evenings.<a id="Marker_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="marker">1043</a></p>

<p>The muscular power of the Flea is so great that it can
leap to the distance of two hundred times its own length,
which will appear the more surprising when we consider
that a man, were he endowed with equal strength and agility,
would be able to leap between three and four hundred
yards. Aristophanes, in his usual licentious way, ridicules
the great Socrates for his pretended experiments on this
great muscular power:</p>

</div>
</div>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_312" title="312"></a><!--313.png-->

<p>The witty Butler has also commemorated the same circumstance
in his justly celebrated poem of Hudibras:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">How many scores a Flea will jump</div>
<div class="line">Of his own length, from head to rump;</div>
<div class="line">Which Socrates and Chærophon</div>
<div class="line">In vain assay’d so long agon.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As illustrative of the strength of the Flea, the following
facts may also be given: We read in a note to Purchas’s
Pilgrims that “one Marke Scaliot, in London, made a lock
and key and chain of forty-three links, all which a Flea did
draw, and weighed but a grain and a half.”<a id="Marker_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="marker">1045</a> Mouffet, who
also records this fact, says he had heard of another Flea
that was harnessed to a golden chariot, which it drew with
the greatest ease.<a id="Marker_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="marker">1046</a> Bingley tells us that Mr. Boverick, an
ingenious watchmaker in the Strand, exhibited some years
ago a little ivory chaise with four wheels, and all its proper
apparatus, and the figure of a man sitting on the box, all of
which were drawn by a single Flea. The same mechanic
afterward constructed a minute landau, which opened and
shut by springs, with the figures of six horses harnessed to
it, and of a coachman on the box, a dog between his legs,
four persons inside, two footmen behind it, and a postillion
riding on one of the fore horses, which were all easily
dragged along by a single Flea. He likewise had a chain
of brass, about two inches long, containing two hundred
links, with a hook at one end and a padlock and key at the
other, which a Flea drew nimbly along.<a id="Marker_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="marker">1047</a> At a fair of
Charlton, in Kent, 1830, a man exhibited three Fleas harnessed
to a carriage in form of an omnibus, at least fifty
times their own bulk, which they pulled along with great
ease; another pair drew a chariot, and a single Flea a
brass cannon. The exhibitor showed the whole first through
a magnifying glass, and then to the naked eye; so that all
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_313" title="313"></a><!--314.png-->
were satisfied there was no deception.<a id="Marker_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="marker">1048</a> Latrielle also mentions
a Flea of a moderate size, which dragged a silver cannon,
mounted on wheels, that was twenty-four times its own
weight, and which being charged with gunpowder was fired
off without the Flea appearing in the least alarmed.<a id="Marker_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="marker">1049</a></p>

<p>It is recorded in Purchas’s Pilgrims that an Egyptian
artisan received a garment of cloth of gold for binding a
Flea in a chain.<a id="Marker_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="marker">1050</a></p>

<p>The Flea is twice mentioned in the Bible, and in both
cases David, in speaking to Saul, applies it to himself as a
term of humility.<a id="Marker_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="marker">1051</a></p>

<p>A Prussian poet, quoted by Jaeger,<a id="Marker_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="marker">1052</a> gives us the song of
a young Flea who had emigrated to this country from Prussia,
and thus expresses his dissatisfaction to his sweetheart:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Kennst de nunmehr das Land, we Dorngestripp und Disteln blüh’n,</div>
<div class="line">Im frost’gen Wald nur eckelhafte Tannenzapfen glüh’n,</div>
<div class="line">Der Schierling tief, und hoch der Sumach steht,</div>
<div class="line">Ein rauher Wind vom schwarzen Himmel weht;</div>
<div class="line">Kennst du es wohl? O lass uns eilig zieh’n,</div>

</div>

<p>An English prose translation of which is: “Know’st
thou now this country, where only briars and thistles bloom;
where ugly fur-nuts only glow in the icy forest; where down
in the vale the fetid hemlock grows, and on the hills the
poisonous sumach; where heavy winds blow from black
clouds over desolate lands? Dost thou not know of this
country? Oh, then, let us fly in haste and return to our
own fatherland!”</p>

<p>“To send one away with a Flea in his ear,” is a very old
English phrase, meaning to dismiss one with a rebuke.<a id="Marker_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="marker">1053</a>
“Flea-luggit” is the Scottish&mdash;to be unsettled or confused.<a id="Marker_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="marker">1054</a></p>

<p>There is a collection of poems called “La Puce des
grands jours de Poitiers”&mdash;the Flea of the carnival of Poitiers.
The poems were begun by the learned Pasquier, who
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_314" title="314"></a><!--315.png-->
edited the collection, upon a Flea which was found one morning
in the bosom of the famous Catherine des Roches.<a id="Marker_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="marker">1055</a></p>

<p>During the winter of 1762, at Norwich, England, after a
chilling storm of snow and wind that had destroyed many
lives, myriads of Fleas were found skipping about on the
snow.<a id="Marker_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="marker">1056</a></p>

<p>To the Pulicidæ belongs also a native of the West Indies
and South America, the <i>Pulex penetrans</i>, variously named
in the countries where it is found, Chigoe, Jigger, Nigua,
Tungua, and Pique. According to Stedman, this “is a
kind of small sand-flea, which gets in between the skin and
the flesh without being felt, and generally under the nails of
the toes, where, while it feeds, it keeps growing till it becomes
of the size of a pea, causing no further pain than a
disagreeable itching. In process of time, its operation appears
in the form of a small bladder, in which are deposited
thousands of eggs, or nits, and which, if it breaks, produce
so many young Chigoes, which, in course of time, create
running ulcers, often of very dangerous consequence to the
patient; so much so, indeed, that I knew a soldier the soles
of whose feet were obliged to be cut away before he could
recover; and some men have lost their limbs by amputation&mdash;nay,
even their lives&mdash;by having neglected in time to
root out these abominable vermin. The moment, therefore,
that a redness and itching more than usual are perceived, it
is time to extract the Chigoe that occasions them. This is
done with a sharp-pointed needle, taking care not to occasion
unnecessary pain, and to prevent the Chigoe from breaking
in the wound. Tobacco ashes are put into the orifice,
by which in a little time the sore is perfectly healed.”<a id="Marker_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="marker">1057</a> The
female slaves are generally employed to extract these pests,
which they do with uncommon dexterity. Old Ligon tells
us he had ten Chigoes taken out of his feet in a morning “by
the most unfortunate Yarico,”<a id="Marker_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="marker">1058</a> whose tragical story is now
so celebrated in prose and verse. Mr. Southey says that
many of the first settlers of Brazil, before they knew the
remedy to extract the Chigoes, lost their feet in the most
dreadful manner.<a id="Marker_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="marker">1059</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_315" title="315"></a><!--316.png-->

<p>Walton, in his Present State of the Spanish Colonies,
tells us of a Capuchin friar, who carried away with him a
colony of Chigoes in his foot as a present to the Scientific
Colleges in Europe; but, unfortunately for himself and for
science, the length of the voyage produced mortification in
his leg, that it became necessary to cut it off to save the
zealous missionary’s life, and the leg, with all its inhabitants,
were tumbled together into the sea.<a id="Marker_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="marker">1060</a></p>

<p>Humboldt observes “that the whites born in the torrid
zone walk barefoot with impunity in the same apartment
where a European, recently landed, is exposed to the attack
of this animal. The <i>Nigua</i>, therefore, distinguishes what
the most delicate chemical analysis could not distinguish,
the cellular membrane and blood of an European from those
of a Creole white.”<a id="Marker_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="marker">1061</a></p>

<p>At Hurdenburg, in Sweden, Mr. Hurst tells us the mode
of choosing a burgomaster is this: The persons eligible sit
around, with their beards upon a table; a Louse is then put
in the middle of the table, and the one, in whose beard this
insect first takes cover, is the magistrate for the ensuing
year.<a id="Marker_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="marker">1062</a></p>

<p>Respecting the revenue of Montecusuma, which consisted
of the natural products of the country, and what was produced
by the industry of his subjects, we find the following
story in Torquemada: “During the abode of Montecusuma
among the Spaniards, in the palace of his father, Alonzo de
Ojeda one day espied in a certain apartment of the building
a number of small bags tied up. He imagined at first that
they were filled with gold dust, but on opening one of them,
what was his astonishment to find it quite full of Lice?
Ojeda, greatly surprised at the discovery he had made, immediately
communicated what he had seen to Cortes, who
then asked Marina and Anguilar for some explanation.
They informed him that the Mexicans had such a sense of
their duty to pay tribute to their monarch, that the poorest
and meanest of the inhabitants, if they possessed nothing
better to present to their king, daily cleaned their persons,
and saved all the Lice they caught, and that when they had
a good store of these, they laid them in bags at the feet of
their monarch.” Torquemada further remarks, that his
reader might think these bags were filled with small worms
(gasanillos), and not with Lice; but appeals to Alonzo de
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_317" title="317"></a><!--318.png-->
Ojeda, and another of Cortes’ soldiers, named Alonzo de
Mata, who were eye-witnesses of the fact.<a id="Marker_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="marker">1063</a></p>

<p>Oviedo pretends to have observed that Lice, at the elevation
of the tropics, abandon the Spanish sailors that are
going to the Indies, and attack them again at the same point
on their return. The same is reported in Purchas’s Pilgrims.<a id="Marker_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="marker">1064</a>
One of the supplementary writers to Cuvier’s History
of Insects says: “This is an observation that has need
of being corroborated by more certain testimonies than we
are yet in possession of. But, if true, there would be nothing
in the fact very surprising. A degree of considerable heat,
and a more abundant perspiration, might prove unfavorable
to the propagation of the <i>Pediculi corporis</i>. As their
skin is more tender, the influence of the air might prove
detrimental to them in those burning climates.”<a id="Marker_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="marker">1065</a></p>

<p>We read in Purchas’s Pilgrims, that “if Lice doe much
annoy the natives of Cambaia and Malabar, they call to
them certain Religious and holy men, after their account:
and these Observants y will take upon them all those Lice
which the other can find, and put them on their head, there
to nourish them. But yet for all this lousie scruple, they
stick not to coozenage by falese weights, measures, and coyne,
nor at usury and lies.”<a id="Marker_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="marker">1066</a></p>

<p>In a side-note to this curious passage, we find: “The like
lousie trick is reported in the Legend of S. <i>Francis</i>, and in
the life of Ignatius, of one of the Jesuitical pillars, by
Moffæus.”</p>

<p>Steedman says of the Caffres, that “except an occasional
plunge in a river, they never wash themselves, and consequently
their bodies are covered with vermin. On a fine day
their karosses are spread out in the sun, and as their tormentors
creep forth they are doomed to destruction. It often happens
that one Caffir performs for another the kind office of
collecting these insects, in which case he preserves the entomological
specimens, carefully delivering them to the person
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_318" title="318"></a><!--319.png-->
to whom they originally appertained, supposing, according to
their theory, that as they derived their support from the blood
of the man from whom they were taken, should they be killed
by another, the blood of his neighbor would be in his possession,
thus placing in his hands the power of some superhuman
influence.”<a id="Marker_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="marker">1067</a></p>

<p>Kolben says the Hottentots eat the largest of the Lice
with which they swarm; and that if asked how they can
devour such detestable vermin, they plead the law of retaliation,
and urge that it is no shame to eat those who would
eat them&mdash;“They suck our blood, and we devour ’em in
revenge.”<a id="Marker_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="marker">1068</a></p>

<p>We are assured in Purchas’s Pilgrims, that Lice and
“long wormes” were sold for food in Mexico.<a id="Marker_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="marker">1069</a> From this
ancient collection of Travels, we learn that when the Indians
of the Province of Cuena are infected with Lice, “they
dresse and cleanse one another; and they that exercise this,
are for the most part women, who eate all that they take,
and have herein (eating?) such dexterity by reason of their
exercise, that our own men cannot lightly attaine thereunto.”<a id="Marker_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="marker">1070</a></p>

<p>The Budini, a people of Scythia, commonly feed upon
Lice and other vermin bred upon their bodies.<a id="Marker_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="marker">1071</a></p>

<p>Mr. Wafer, in his description of the Isthmus of America,
says: “The natives have Lice in their Heads, which they
feel out with their Fingers, and eat as they catch them.”<a id="Marker_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="marker">1072</a>
Dobrizhoffer also mentions that Lice are eaten by the Indian
women of South America.<a id="Marker_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="marker">1073</a></p>

<p>The disgusting practice of eating these vermin is not confined
to the Hottentots, the Negroes of Western Africa, the
Simiæ, and the American Indians, for it has been observed
to prevail among the beggars of Spain and Portugal.<a id="Marker_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="marker">1074</a></p>

<p>Schroder, in his History of Animals that are useful in
Physic, says: “Lice are swallowed by country people
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_319" title="319"></a><!--320.png-->
against the jaundice.”<a id="Marker_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="marker">1075</a> As a specific against this disease,
Beaumont and Fletcher thus allude to them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Die of the jaundice, yet have the cure about you: lice, large lice,
begot of your own dust and the heat of the brick kilns.<a id="Marker_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="marker">1076</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lice were also made use of in cases of Atrophy, and
Dioscorides says they were employed in suppressions of
urine, being introduced into the canal of the urethra.<a id="Marker_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="marker">1077</a></p>

<p>In the Gentleman’s Magazine for 1746, there is a curious
letter on “a certain <i>creature</i>, of rare and extraordinary
qualities”&mdash;a Louse, containing many humorous observations
on this “<i>lover</i> of the human race,” and concluding
with some queries as to its origin and pedigree. “Was it,”
the writer asks, “created within the six days assigned by
<i>Moses</i> for the formation of all things? If so, where was
its habitation? We can hardly suppose that it was quartered
on <i>Adam</i> or his lady, the neatest, nicest pair (if we
believe <i>John Milton</i>) that ever joyned hands. And yet, as
it disdained to graze the fields, or lick the dust for sustenance,
where else could it have had its subsistence?”<a id="Marker_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="marker">1078</a></p>

<p>In a modern account of Scotland, written by an English
gentleman, and printed in the year 1670, we find the following:
“In that interval between Adam and Moses, when the
Scottish Chronicle commences, the country was then baptized
(and most think with the sign of the cross) by the
venerable name of Scotland, from Scota, the daughter of
Pharaoh, King of Egypt. Hence came the rise and name
of these present inhabitants, as their Chronicle informs us,
and is not to be doubted of, from divers considerable circumstances;
the plagues of Egypt being entailed upon
them, that of Lice (being a judgment unrepealed) is an
ample testimony, these loving animals accompanied them
from Egypt, and remain with them to this day, never forsaking
them (but as rats leave a house) till they tumble into their
graves.”<a id="Marker_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="marker">1079</a></p>

<p>Linnæus, seemingly very anxious to become an apologist
for the Lice, gravely observes that they probably preserve
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_320" title="320"></a><!--321.png-->
children who are troubled with them, from a variety of complaints
to which they would be liable!<a id="Marker_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="marker">1080</a></p>

<p>As an attempt toward discovering the intention of Providence
in permitting the frequency of these tormenting animals,
the following lines of Serenus may be given:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">See nature, kindly provident ordain</div>
<div class="line">Her gentle stimulants to harmless pain;</div>
<div class="line">Lest Man, the slave of rest, should waste away</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Of the horrible disease, Phthiriasis, occasioned by myriads
of Lice, <i>Pediculi</i>, and sometimes by Mites, <i>Acari</i>, and <i>Larvæ</i>
in general, I shall but mention that the inhuman Pheretrina,
Antiochus Epiphanes, the Dictator Sylla, the two Herods,
the Emperor Maximin, and Philip the Second were among
the number carried off by it.</p>

<p>Quintus Serenus speaks thus of the death of Sylla:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Great Sylla too the fatal scourge hath known;</div>
<div class="line">Slain by a host far mightier than his own.</div>

<p>According to Pliny, Nits are destroyed by using dog’s
fat, eating serpents cooked like eels, or else taking their
sloughs in drink.<a id="Marker_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="marker">1081</a></p>

<p>In Leyden’s Notes to Complaynt of Scotland are recorded
the following few rhymes of the Gyre-carlin&mdash;the bug-bear

<h3 id="Pedipalpi_Scorpions">Pedipalpi&mdash;Scorpions.</h3>

<p>Concerning the generation of the Scorpion, Topsel, in
his History of Four-footed Beasts and Serpents, printed in
1658, treats as follows:</p>

<p>“Now, then, it followeth that we inquire about the manner
of their (Scorpions’) breed or generation, which I find
to be double, as divers authors have observed, one way is
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_322" title="322"></a><!--323.png-->
by putrefaction, and the other by laying of egges, and both
these ways are consonant to nature, for Lacinius writeth
that some creatures are generated only by propagation of
seed&mdash;such are men, vipers, whales, and the palm-tree;
some again only by putrefaction, as mice, Scorpions, Emmets,
Spiders, purslain, which, first of all, were produced by putrefaction,
and since their generation are conserved by the
seed and egges of their own kinde. Now, therefore, we
will first of all speak of the generation of Scorpions by putrefaction,
and afterward by propagation.</p>

<p>“Pliny saith<a id="Marker_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="marker">1085</a> that when Sea-crabs dye, and their bodies
are dried upon the earth, when the sun entereth into Cancer
and Scorpius, out of the putrefaction thereof ariseth a
Scorpion; and so out of the putrefied body of the crefish
burned arise Scorpions, which caused Ovid thus to write:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Concava littoreo si demas brachia cancro,</div>
<div class="line">Cætera supponas terræ, de parte sepulta</div>
<div class="line">Scorpius exibit, caudaque minabitur unca.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And again:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Obrutus exemptis cancer tellure lacertis,</div>
<div class="line">Scorpius exiguo tempore factus erit.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In English thus:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">If that the arms you take from Sea-crab-fish,</div>
<div class="line">And put the rest in earth till all consumed be,</div>
<div class="line">Out of the buried part a Scorpion will arise,</div>
<div class="line">With hooked tayl doth threaten for to hurt thee.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“And therefore it is reported by Ælianus that about Estamenus,
in India, there are abundance of Scorpions generated
only by corrupt rain-water standing in that place.
Also out of the Basalisk beaten into pieces and so putrefied
are Scorpions engendered. And when as one had
planted the herb basilica on a wall, in the room or place
thereof he found two Scorpions. And some say that if a man
chaw in his mouth fasting this herb basill before he wash, and
afterward lay the same abroad uncovered where no sun
cometh at it for the space of seven nights, taking it in all
the daytime, he shall at length finde it transmuted into a
Scorpion, with a tayl of seven knots.<a id="Marker_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="marker">1086</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_323" title="323"></a><!--324.png-->

<p>“Hollerius,<a id="Marker_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="marker">1087</a> to take away all scruple of this thing, writeth
that in Italy in his dayes there was a man that had a Scorpion
bred in his brain by continuall smelling to this herb
basill; and Gesner, by relation of an apothecary in France,
writeth likewise a story of a young maid who, by smelling
to basill, fell into an exceeding headache, whereof she died
without cure, and after death, being opened, there were
found little Scorpions in her brain.</p>

<p>“Aristotle remembreth an herb which he calleth sissimbria,
out of which putrefied Scorpions are engendered, as
he writeth. And we have shewed already, in the history of
the Crocodile, that out of the Crocodile’s egges do many
times come Scorpions, which at their first egression do kill
their dam that hatched them, which caused Archelaus, which
wrote epigrams of wonders unto Ptolemæus, to sing of Scorpions
in this manner:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">In vos dissolvit morte, et redigit crocodilum</div>
<div class="line">Natura extinctum, Scorpii omnipotens.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Which may be Englished thus:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">To you by Scorpions death the omnipotent</div>
<div class="line">Ruines the crocodil in nature’s life extinct.”<a id="Marker_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="marker">1088</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The remarks referred to by Topsel in the last paragraph
in his history of the Crocodile are as follows:</p>

<p>“It is said by Philes that, after the egge is laid by the
crocodile, many times there is a cruel Stinging Scorpion
which cometh out thereof, and woundeth the crocodile that
laid it.<a id="Marker_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="marker">1089</a></p>

<p>“The Scorpion also and the crocodile are enemies one to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_324" title="324"></a><!--325.png-->
the other, and therefore when the Egyptians will describe
the combat of two notable enemies, they paint a crocodile
and a Scorpion fighting together, for ever one of them killeth
another; but if they will decipher a speedy overthrow
to one’s enemy, then they picture a crocodile; if a slow and
slack victory, they picture a Scorpion.”<a id="Marker_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="marker">1090</a></p>

<p>“Some maintain,” says Moufet, “that they (Scorpions)
are not bred by copulation, but by exceeding heat of the
sun. Ælian, <i>lib. 6</i>, <i>de Anim. cap. 22</i>, among whom Galen
must first be blamed, who in his Book <i>de fœt. form.</i> will
not have nature, but chance to be the parent of Scorpions,
Flies, Spiders, Worms of all sorts, and he ascribes their beginning
to the uncertain constitutions of the heavens, place,
matter, heat, etc.”<a id="Marker_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="marker">1091</a></p>

<p>Topsel further says: “The principall of all other subjects
of their (the Scorpions’) hatred are virgins and women,
whom they do not only desire to harm, but also when they
have harmed are never perfectly recovered. (Albertus).…</p>

<p>“The lion is by the Scorpion put to flight wheresoever he
seeith it, for he feareth it as the enemy of his life, and therefore
writeth S. Ambrose, <i>Exiguo Scorpionis aculeo exagitatur
leo</i>, the lion is much moved at the small sting of a
Scorpion.”<a id="Marker_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="marker">1092</a></p>

<p>Naude tells us that there is a species of Scorpions in
Italy, which are so domesticated as to be put between sheets
to cool the beds during the heat of summer.<a id="Marker_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="marker">1093</a> Pliny mentions
that the Scorpions of Italy are harmless.<a id="Marker_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="marker">1094</a></p>

<p>Among the curious things recorded by Pliny concerning
the Scorpion, the following have been selected: Some
writers, he says, are of opinion that the Scorpion devours
its offspring, and that the one among the young which is the
most adroit avails itself of its sole mode of escape by placing
itself on the back of the mother, and thus finding a place
where it is in safety from the tail and the sting. The one
that thus escapes, they say, becomes the avenger of the rest,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_325" title="325"></a><!--326.png-->
and at last, taking advantage of its elevated position, puts
its parent to death.<a id="Marker_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="marker">1095</a></p>

<p>According to Pliny, those who carry the plant “tricoccum,”
or, as it is also called, “scorpiuron,”<a id="Marker_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="marker">1096</a> about their
person are never stung by a Scorpion, and it is said, he continues,
that if a circle is traced on the ground around a
Scorpion with a sprig of this plant, the animal will never
move out of it, and that if a Scorpion is covered with it, or
even sprinkled with the water in which it has been steeped,
it will die that instant.<a id="Marker_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="marker">1097</a></p>

<p>Attalus assures us, says Pliny, that if a person, the moment
he sees a Scorpion, says “Duo,”<a id="Marker_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="marker">1098</a> the reptile will stop
short and forbear to sting.<a id="Marker_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="marker">1099</a></p>

<p>Concerning Scorpions, Diophanes, contemporary with
Cæsar and Cicero, has collected the following several
opinions of the more ancient writers: If you take a Scorpion,
he says, and burn it, the others will betake themselves
to flight: and if a person carefully rubs his hands with the
juice of radish, he may without fear and danger take hold
of Scorpions, and of other reptiles: and radishes laid on
Scorpions instantly destroy them. You will also cure the
bite of a Scorpion, by applying a silver ring to the place.
A suffumigation of sandarach<a id="Marker_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="marker">1100</a> with galbanum, or goat’s fat,
will drive away Scorpions and every other reptile. If a person
will also boil a Scorpion in oil, and will rub the place
bit by a Scorpion, he will stop the pain.<a id="Marker_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="marker">1101</a> But Apuleius
says, that if a person bit by a Scorpion sits on an ass, turned
toward its tail, that the ass suffers the pain, and that it is
destroyed.<a id="Marker_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="marker">1102</a> Democritus says that a person bit by a Scorpion,
who instantly says to his ass, “A Scorpion has bit
me,” will suffer no pain, but it passes to the ass.<a id="Marker_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="marker">1103</a> The newt
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_326" title="326"></a><!--327.png-->
has an antipathy to the Scorpion: if a person, therefore,
melts a newt in oil, and applies the oil to the person that is
bitten, he frees him from pain. The same author also says
that the root of a rose-tree being applied, cures persons bit
by Scorpions. Plutarch recommends to fasten small nuts to
the feet of the bed, that Scorpions may not approach it.
Zoroaster says that lettuce-seed, being drunk with wine,
cures persons bit by Scorpions. Florentinus says, if one
applies the juice of the fig to the wound of a person just
bitten, that the poison will proceed no farther; or, if the
person bit eat squill, he will not be hurt, but he will say
that the squill is pleasant to his palate. Tarentinus also
says that a person holding the herb sideritis may take
hold of Scorpions, and not be hurt by them.<a id="Marker_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="marker">1104</a> Dioscorides,
among many other remedies for the sting of the Scorpion,
prescribes “a fish called <i>Lacerta</i>, salted and cut in pieces;
the barbel fish cut in two; the flesh of a fish called <i>Smaris;</i>
house-mice cut asunder; horse or ass dung; the shell of an
Indian small nut; ram’s flesh burnt; mummie, four grains,
with butter and cow’s milk; a broiled Scorpion eaten; river-crabs
raw and bruised, and drank with asses’ milk: locusts
broiled and eaten,” etc. Rabby Moyses prescribes pigeon’s
dung dried; Constantinus, hens’ dung, or the heart applied
outwardly; Anatolius, crows’ dung; Averrhois, the bezoar-stone;
Monus, silver; Silvaticus, from Serapis, pewter; and
Orpheus, coral.</p>

<div class="poem">

<div class="line">Men say that houseleek hath so soveraign a might,</div>
<div class="line">Who carries but that, no Scorpion can him bite.”<a id="Marker_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="marker">1105</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The natives of South Africa, when bitten by a Scorpion,
apply, as a remedy, a living frog to the wound, into which
animal it is supposed the poison is transferred from the
wound, and it dies; then they apply another, which dies
also: the third perhaps only becomes sickly, and the fourth
no way affected. When this is observed, the poison is considered
to be extracted, and the patient cured. Another
method is to apply a kidney, scarlet, or other bean, which
swells; then apply another and another, till the bean ceases
to be affected, when they consider the poison extracted.<a id="Marker_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="marker">1106</a></p>

<p>There is a vast desert tract, says Pliny, on this side of the
Ethiopian Cynamolgi&mdash;the “dog-milkers”&mdash;the inhabitants
of which were exterminated by Scorpions and venomous
ants.<a id="Marker_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="marker">1107</a></p>

<p>Navarette tells us, in the account of his voyage to the
Philippine Islands, that there was there in practice a good
and easy remedy against the Scorpions which abound in that
country. This was, when they went to bed, to make a commemoration
of St. George. He himself, he says, for many
years continued this devotion, and, “God be praised,” he
adds, “the Saint always delivered me both there and in
other countries from those and such like insects.” He confesses,
however, they used another remedy besides, which was
to rub all about the beds with garlic.<a id="Marker_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="marker">1108</a></p>

<p>Navarette<a id="Marker_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="marker">1109</a> and Barbot<a id="Marker_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="marker">1110</a> both tell us that a certain remedy
against the sting of a Scorpion, is to rub the wound with a
child’s private member. This, the latter adds, immediately
takes away the pain, and then the venom exhales. The
moisture that comes from a hen’s mouth, Barbot says, is
also good for the same.</p>

<p>The Persians believe that Scorpions may be deprived of
the power of stinging, by means of a certain prayer which
they make use of for that purpose. The person who has the
power of “binding the Scorpion,” as it is called, turns his
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_328" title="328"></a><!--329.png-->
face toward the sign Scorpio, in the heavens, and repeats
this prayer; while every person present, at the conclusion of
a sentence, claps his hands. After this is done they think
that they are perfectly safe; nor, if they should chance to
see any Scorpions during that night, do they scruple to take
hold of them, trusting to the efficacy of this fancied all-powerful
charm. “I have frequently seen,” says Francklin,
“the man in whose family I lived, repeat the above-mentioned
prayer, on being desired by his children to bind the Scorpions;
after which the whole family has gone quietly and
contentedly to bed, fully persuaded that they could receive
no hurt by them.”<a id="Marker_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="marker">1111</a></p>

<p>Bell says the Persians “have such a dread of these creatures,
that, when provoked by any person, they wish a Kashan
Scorpion may sting him.”<a id="Marker_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="marker">1112</a></p>

<p>An old story is, that a Scorpion surrounded with live
coals, finding no method of escaping, grows desperate from
its situation, and stings itself to death. This, though considered
a mere fable of antiquity, may still have some truth,
if we believe the following from the pen of Ulloa: “We
more than once,” says this traveler, “entertained ourselves
with an experiment of putting a Scorpion into a glass vessel,
and injecting a little smoke of tobacco, and immediately
by stopping it found that its aversion to this smell is such,
that it falls into the most furious agitations, till, giving itself
several stings on the head, it finds relief by destroying
itself.”<a id="Marker_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="marker">1113</a> There is also told a story in the East Indies, that
“the Scorpion is sometimes so pestered with the pismires,
that he stings himself to death in the head with his tail, and
so becomes a prey to the pismires.”<a id="Marker_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="marker">1114</a></p>

<p>The Scorpion was an emblem of the Egyptian goddess
Selk; and she is usually found represented with this animal
bound upon her head.<a id="Marker_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="marker">1115</a></p>

<p>Ælian mentions Scorpions of Coptos, which, though inflicting
a deadly sting, and dreaded by the people, so far respected
the Egyptian goddess Isis, who was particularly
worshiped in that city, that women, in going to express
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_329" title="329"></a><!--330.png-->
their grief before her, walked with bare feet, or lay upon
the ground, without receiving any injury from them.<a id="Marker_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="marker">1116</a></p>

<p>The Ethiopians that dwell near the River Hydaspis commonly
eat Scorpions and serpents without the slightest harm,
“which certainly proceeds from no other thing than a secret
and wonderful constitution of the body!” says Mercurialis.<a id="Marker_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="marker">1117</a></p>

<p>Lutfullah, the learned Mohammedan gentleman, in his
Autobiography, relates the following:</p>

<p>“On the morning of the 11th (April, 1839), I ordered my
servant boy to shake my bedding and put it in the sun for
an hour or so, that the moisture imbibed by the quilt might
be dried. As soon as the quilt was removed from its place,
what did I behold but an immense Scorpion, tapering towards
its tail of nine vertebræ, armed with a sting at the
end, crawling with impunity at the edge of the carpet. I
had never seen such a large monster before. It was black
in the body, with small bristles all over, dark green in the
tail, and red at the sting. This hideous sight rendered me
and the servant horror-struck. In the mean time, an Afghan
friend of mine, by name Ata Mohamed Khan Kakar, a respectable
resident of the town, honoured me with a visit,
and, seeing the reptile, observed, ‘Lutfullah, you are a lucky
man, having made a narrow escape this morning. This cursed
worm is called Jerrara, and its fatal sting puts a period to
animal life in a moment; return, therefore, your thanks to
the Lord, all merciful, who gave you a new life in having
saved you from the mortal sting of this evil bed-companion
of yours.’ ‘I have no fear of the worm,’ replied I, ‘for it
dare not sting me unless it is written in the book of fate to
be stung by it.’ Saying this, I made the animal crawl into
a small earthen vessel, and stopped the mouth of it with
clay; and then making a large fire, I put the vessel therein
for an hour or so, to turn the reptile into ashes, which, administered
in doses of half a grain to adults, are a specific
remedy for violent colicky pains.”<a id="Marker_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="marker">1118</a></p>

<p>The ashes of burnt Scorpions, besides being good for
colicky pains, as Lutfullah says, were often prescribed by
the ancient physicians for stone in the bladder;<a id="Marker_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="marker">1119</a> and Topsel,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_330" title="330"></a><!--331.png-->
quoting Kiranides, has the following: “If a man take a
vulgar Scorpion and drown the same in a porringer of oyl
in the wane of the moon, and therewithall afterward anoynt
the back from the shoulders to the hips, and also the head
and forehead, with the tips of the fingers and toes of one
that is a demoniack or a lunatick person, it is reported, that
he shall ease and cure him in short time. And the like is
reported of the Scorpion’s sting joyned with the top of basil
wherein is seed, and with the heart of a swallow, all included
in a piece of harts skin.”<a id="Marker_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="marker">1120</a> The oil of Scorpions,
Brassavolus says, “drives out worms miraculously;” and
oil of Scorpions’ and vipers’ “tongues is a most excellent
remedy against the plague, as Crinitus testifies, i. 7.”<a id="Marker_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="marker">1121</a>
Galen prescribes Scorpions for jaundice, and Kiranides the
same for the several kinds of ague. “Plinius Secundus saith,
that a quartan ague, as the magicians report, will be cured
in three daies by a Scorpion’s four last joynts of his tail, together
with the gristle of his ear, so wrapped up in a black
cloth, that the sick patient may neither perceive the Scorpion
that is applied, nor him that bound it on.… Samonicus
commends Scorpions against pains in the eyes, in
these verses:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">If that some grievous pain perplex thy sight,</div>
<div class="line">Wool wet in oyl is good bound on all night.</div>
<div class="line">Carry about thee a live Scorpion’s eye,</div>

<p>The following Asiatic fable of the Scorpion and the Tortoise
is from the Beharistan of Jamy: A Scorpion, armed
with pernicious sting and filthy poison, undertook a journey.
Coming to the bank of a wide river, he stopped in great
perplexity, wanting height of leg to cross over, yet very unwilling
to return. A Tortoise, seeing his situation, and
moved with compassion, took him on his back, sprang into
the river, and was swimming toward the opposite shore,
when he heard a noise on his shell as of something striking
him; he called out to know what it was; the ungrateful
Scorpion answered, “It is the motion of my sting only, I
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_331" title="331"></a><!--332.png-->
know it cannot affect you, but it is a habit which I cannot
relinquish.” “Indeed,” replied the Tortoise, “then I cannot
do better than free so evil-minded a creature from his bad
disposition, and secure the good from his malevolence.”
Saying which he dived under the water, and the waves soon
carried the Scorpion beyond the bourn of existence.</p>

<p>Topsel, in his History of Four-footed Beasts and Serpents,
has the following in his chapter on the Scorpion:</p>

<p>“There is a common adage, <i>Cornix Scorpium</i>, a Raven
to a Scorpion, and it is used against them that perish by
their own inventions: when they set upon others, they meet
with their matches, as a raven did when it preyed upon a
Scorpion, thus described by Alciatus, under his title <i>Justa
ultio</i>, just revenge, saying as followeth:</p>

<div class="line">The ravening crow for prey a Scorpion took</div>
<div class="line i2">  Within her foot, and therewithal aloft did flie,</div>

<p>“There be some learned writers, who have compared a
Scorpion to an epigram, or rather an epigram to a Scorpion,
because as the sting of the Scorpion lyeth in the
tayl, so the force and vertue of an epigram is in the conclusion,
for <i>vel acriter salse mordeat, vel jucunde atque dulciter
delectet</i>, that is, either let it bite sharply at the end,
or else delight pleasingly.”<a id="Marker_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="marker">1124</a></p>

<p>“Domitian sometime,” says Hollingshed incidentally in
his Chronicles of England, “and an other prince yet living,
delited so much to see the iollie combats betwixt a stout
Flie and an old Spider.… Some parasites also in the
time of the aforesaid emperour (when they were disposed
to laugh at his follie, and yet would seem in appearance to
gratifie his fantasticall head with some shew of dutiful demenour)
could devise to set their lorde on worke, by letting
a fresh flie privilie into his chamber, which he foorthwith
would egerlie have hunted (all other businesse set apart)
and never ceased till he had caught him in his fingers:
whereupon arose the proverbe ‘ne musca quidem,’ altered
first by Vitius Priscus, who being asked whether anie bodie
was with Domitian, answered ‘ne musca quidem,’ whereby
he noted his follie. There are some cockes combs here
and there in England, learning it abroad as men transregionate,
which make account also of this pastime, as of a
notable matter, telling what a fight is seene betweene them,
if either of them be lustie and couragious in his kind. One
also hath mad a booke of the Spider and the Flie, wherein
he dealeth so profoundlie, and beyond all measure of skill,
that neither he himself that made it, neither anie one that
readeth it can reach unto the meaning thereof.”<a id="Marker_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="marker">1126</a></p>

<p>Chapelain, the author of Pucelle, was called by the academicians
the Knight of the Order of the Spider, because he
was so avaricious, that though he had an income of 13,000
livres, and more than 240,000 in ready money, he wore an old
coat so patched, pieced, and threadbare, that the stitches exhibited
no bad resemblance to the fibers produced by that
insect. Being one day present at a large party given by
the great Condé, a Spider of uncommon size fell from the
ceiling upon the floor. The company thought it could not
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_333" title="333"></a><!--334.png-->
have come from the roof, and all the ladies at once agreed
that it must have proceeded from Chapelain’s wig;&mdash;the
wig so celebrated by the well-known parody.<a id="Marker_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="marker">1127</a></p>

<p>The often-told anecdote of the Scottish monarch, Robert
Bruce, and the cottage Spider, is thus related in Chambers’
Miscellany: While wandering on the wild hills of Carrick,
in order to escape the emissaries of Edward, Robert the
Bruce on one occasion passed the night under the shelter of
a poor deserted cottage. Throwing himself down on a
heap of straw, he lay upon his back, with his hands placed
under his head, unable to sleep, but gazing vacantly upward
at the rafters of the hut, disfigured with cobwebs. From
thoughts long and dreary about the hopelessness of the enterprise
in which he was engaged, and the misfortunes he
had already encountered, he was roused to take interest in
the efforts of a poor industrious Spider, which had begun to
ply its vocation with the first gray light of morning. The
object of the animal was to swing itself, by its thread, from
one rafter to another; but in the attempt it repeatedly
failed, each time vibrating back to the point whence it had
made the effort. Twelve times did the little creature try to
reach the desired spot, and as many times was it unsuccessful.
Not disheartened with its failure, it made the attempt
once more, and, lo! the rafter was gained. “The thirteenth
time,” said Bruce, springing to his feet; “I accept it as a
lesson not to despond under difficulties, and shall once more
venture my life in the struggle for the independence of my
beloved country.” The result is well known.<a id="Marker_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="marker">1128</a></p>

<p>It is related in the life of Mohammed, that when he and
Abubeker were fleeing for their lives before the Coreishites,
they hid themselves for three days in a cave, over the mouth
of which a Spider spread its web, and a pigeon laid two
eggs there, the sight of which made the pursuers not go in
to search for them.<a id="Marker_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="marker">1129</a></p>

<p>A similar story is told in the Lives of the Saints, of St.
Felix of Nola: “But the Saint,” says Butler, “in the mean
time had slept a little out of the way, and crept through a
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_334" title="334"></a><!--335.png-->
hole in a ruinous old wall, which was instantly closed up
by Spiders’ webs. His enemies, never imagining anything
could have lately passed where they saw so close a Spider’s
web, after a fruitless search elsewhere, returned in the evening
without their prey. Felix finding among the ruins,
between two houses, an old well half dry, hid himself in it
for six months; and received during that time wherewithal
to subsist by means of a devout Christian woman.”<a id="Marker_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="marker">1130</a></p>

<p>It is said of Heliogabalus, that, for the purpose of estimating

<p>Illustrative of the singularly pleasurable effect of music
upon Spiders, in the Historie de la Musique, et de ses
Effets, we find the following relation:</p>

<p>“Monsieur de &mdash;&mdash;, captain of the Regiment of Navarre,
was confined six months in prison for having spoken
too freely of M. de Louvois, when he begged leave of the governor
to grant him permission to send for his lute to soften
his confinement. He was greatly astonished after four days
to see at the time of his playing the mice come out of their
holes, and the Spiders descend from their webs, who came
and formed in a circle round him to hear him with attention.
This at first so much surprised him, that he stood still without
motion, when having ceased to play, all those Spiders
retired quietly into their lodgings; such an assembly made
the officer fall into reflections upon what the ancients had
told of Orpheus, Arion, and Amphion. He assured me
he remained six days without again playing, having with
difficulty recovered from his astonishment, not to mention a
natural aversion he had for this sort of insects, nevertheless
he began afresh to give a concert to these animals, who
seemed to come every day in greater numbers, as if they had
invited others, so that in process of time he found a hundred
of them about him. In order to rid himself of them he
desired one of the jailors to give him a cat, which he sometimes
shut up in a cage when he wished to have this company
and let her loose when he had a mind to dismiss them,
making it thus a kind of comedy that alleviated his imprisonment.
I long doubted the truth of this story, but it was
confirmed to me six months ago by M.&nbsp;P&mdash;&mdash;, intendant
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_335" title="335"></a><!--336.png-->
of the duchy of V&mdash;&mdash;, a man of merit and probity,
who played upon several instruments to the utmost excellence.
He told me that being at &mdash;&mdash;, he went into his
chamber to refresh himself after a walk, and took up a
violin to amuse himself till supper time, setting a light upon
the table before him; he had not played a quarter of an hour
before he saw several spiders descend from the ceiling, who
came and ranged themselves round about the table to hear
him play, at which he was greatly surprised, but this did not
interrupt him, being willing to see the end of so singular an
occurrence. They remained on the table very attentively
till somebody came to tell him that supper was ready, when
having ceased to play, he told me these insects remounted to
their webs, to which he would suffer no injury to be done.
It was a diversion with which he often entertained himself
out of curiosity.”<a id="Marker_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="marker">1132</a></p>

<p>The Abbé Olivet has described an amusement of Pelisson
during his confinement in the Bastile for refusing to betray
to the government certain secrets intrusted to him by a
friend who was a leading politician at the court of Louis
XIV., which consisted in feeding a Spider, which he discovered
forming its web across the only air-hole of his cell.
For some time he placed his flies at the edge of the window,
while a stupid Basque, his sole companion, played on a
bagpipe. Little by little the Spider used itself to distinguish
the sound of the instrument, and issued from its hole
to run and catch its prey. Thus calling it always by the
same sound, and placing the flies at a still greater distance,
he succeeded, after several months, to drill the Spider by
regular exercise, so that at length it never failed appearing
at the first sound to seize on the fly provided for it, at the
extremity of the cell, and even on the knees of the prisoner.<a id="Marker_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="marker">1133</a></p>

<p>At a ladies’ school at Kensington, England, an immense
species of Spider is said to be uncomfortably common; and
that when the young ladies sing their accustomed hymn or
psalm before morning and evening prayers, these Spiders
make their appearance on the floor, or suspended overhead
from their webs in the ceiling, obviously attracted by the
“concord of sweet sounds.”<a id="Marker_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="marker">1134</a></p>

<p>The following lines “to a Spider which inhabited a cell,”
are from the Anthologia Borealis et Australis:</p>

<p>“When the great and brilliant Lauzun was held in captivity,
his only joy and comfort was a friendly Spider: she
came at his call; she took her food from his finger, and well
understood his word of command. In vain did jailors and
soldiers try to deceive his tiny companion; she would not
obey their voices, and refused the tempting bait from their
hand. Here, then, was not only an ear, but a keen power
of distinction. The despised little animal listened with
sweet affection, and knew how to discriminate between not
unsimilar tones.”<a id="Marker_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="marker">1136</a></p>

<p>Quatremer Disjonval, a Frenchman by birth, was an adjutant-general
in Holland, and took an active part on the
side of the Dutch patriots when they revolted against the
Stadtholder. On the arrival of the Prussian army under
the Duke of Brunswick, he was immediately taken, tried,
and, having been condemned to twenty-five years’ imprisonment,
was incarcerated in a dungeon at Utrecht, where he
remained eight years. During this long confinement, by
many curious observations upon his sole companions, Spiders,
he discovered that they were in the highest degree
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_337" title="337"></a><!--338.png-->
sensitive of approaching changes in the atmosphere, and
that their retirement and reappearance, their weaving and
general habits, were intimately connected with the changes
of the weather. In the reading of these living barometers
he became wonderfully accurate, so much so, that he could
prognosticate the approach of severe weather from ten to
fourteen days before it set in, which is proven by the following
remarkable fact, which led to his release: “When the
troops of the French republic overran Holland in the winter
of 1794, and kept pushing forward over the ice, a sudden
and unexpected thaw, in the early part of December,
threatened the destruction of the whole army unless it was
instantly withdrawn. The French generals were thinking
seriously of accepting a sum offered by the Dutch, and withdrawing
their troops, when Disjonval, who hoped that the
success of the republican army might lead to his release,
used every exertion, and at length succeeded in getting a
letter conveyed to the French general in 1795, in which he
pledged himself, from the peculiar actions of the Spiders,
of whose movements he was enabled to judge with perfect
accuracy, that within fourteen days there would commence
a most severe frost, which would make the French masters
of all the rivers, and afford them sufficient time to complete
and make sure of the conquest they had commenced, before
it should be followed by a thaw. The commander of
the French forces believed his prognostication, and persevered.
The cold weather, which Disjonval had predicted,
made its appearance in twelve days, and with such intensity,
that the ice over the rivers and canals became capable
of bearing the heaviest artillery. On the 28th of January,
1795, the French army entered Utrecht in triumph; and
Quatremer Disjonval, who had watched the habits of his
Spiders with so much intelligence and success, was, as a
reward for his ingenuity, released from prison.”<a id="Marker_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="marker">1137</a></p>

<p>In Bartholomæus, De Proprietatibus Rerum (printed by
Th. Berthelet, 27th Henry VIII.), lib. xviii. fol. 314, speaking
of Pliny, we read: “Also he saythe, spynners (Spiders)
ben tokens of divynation and of knowing what wether shal
fal, for oft by weders that shal fal, some spin and weve
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_338" title="338"></a><!--339.png-->
higher or lower. Also he saythe, that multytude of spynners
is token of moche reyne.”<a id="Marker_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="marker">1138</a></p>

<p>Willsford, in his Nature’s Secrets, p. 131, tells us: “Spiders
creep out of their holes and narrow receptacles against
wind or rain; Minerva having made them sensible of an
approaching storm.”<a id="Marker_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="marker">1139</a></p>

<p>Hone, in his Every Day Book, also mentions that from
Spiders prognostications as to the weather may be drawn;
and gives the following instructions to read this animal-barometer:
“If the weather is likely to become rainy,
windy, or in other respects disagreeable, they fix the terminating
filaments, on which the whole web is suspended,
unusually short; and in this state they await the influence
of a temperature which is remarkably variable. On the
contrary, if the terminating filaments are uncommonly long,
we may, in proportion to their length, conclude that the
weather will be serene, and continue so at least for ten or
twelve days. But if the Spiders be totally indolent, rain
generally succeeds; though, on the other hand, their activity
during rain is the most certain proof that it will be only of
short duration, and followed with fair and constant weather.
According to further observations, the Spiders regularly
make some alterations in their webs or nets every twenty-four
hours; if these changes take place between the hours
of six and seven in the evening, they indicate a clear and
pleasant night.”<a id="Marker_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="marker">1140</a></p>

<p>Pausanias tells us that after the slaughter at Chæronea,
the Thebans were obliged to place a guard within the walls
of their city; but which, however, after the death of Philip,
and during the reign of Alexander, they drove out. For
this action, this historian continues, it was that Divinity
gave them tokens in the webs of Spiders of the destruction
that awaited them. For, during the battle at Leuctra, the
Spiders in the temple of Ceres Thesmophoros wove white
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_339" title="339"></a><!--340.png-->
webs about the doors; but when Alexander and the Macedonians
attacked their dominions, their webs were found to
be black.<a id="Marker_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="marker">1141</a></p>

<p>It was thought by the Classical Ancients and the old
English unlucky to kill Spiders; and prognostications were
made from their manner of weaving their webs.<a id="Marker_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="marker">1142</a> It is still
thought unlucky to injure these animals.</p>

<p>Park has the following note in his copy of Bourne and
Brande’s Popular Antiquities, p. 93: “Small Spiders, termed
<i>money-spinners</i>, are held by many to prognosticate good
luck, if they are not destroyed or injured, or removed from
the person on whom they are first observed.”</p>

<p>In Teviotdale, Scotland, “when Spiders creep on one’s
clothes, it is viewed as betokening good luck; and to destroy
them is equivalent to throwing stones at one’s own head.”<a id="Marker_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="marker">1143</a></p>

<p>In Maryland, this superstition is thus expressed: If you
kill a Spider upon your clothing, you destroy the presents
they are then weaving for you.</p>

<p>In the Secret Memoirs of Mr. Duncan Campbell, p. 60,
in the chapter of omens, we read that “others have thought
themselves secure of receiving money, if by chance a little
Spider fell upon their clothes.”<a id="Marker_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="marker">1144</a></p>

<p>“When a Spider is found upon your clothes, or about
your person,” says a writer in the Notes and Queries,<a id="Marker_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="marker">1145</a> “it
signifies that you will shortly receive some money. Old
Fuller, who was a native of Northamptonshire, thus quaintly
moralizes this superstition: ‘When a Spider is found upon
your clothes, we used to say some money is coming toward
us. The moral is this: such who imitate the industry of
that contemptible creature may, by God’s blessing, weave
themselves into wealth and procure a plentiful estate.’”<a id="Marker_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="marker">1146</a></p>

<p>A South Northamptonshire superstition of the present
day is, that, in order to propitiate money-spinners, they
must be thrown over the left shoulder.<a id="Marker_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="marker">1147</a></p>

<p>It is most probable that Euclio, in Plautus’ Aulularia,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_340" title="340"></a><!--341.png-->
would not suffer the Spiders to be molested because they
were considered to bring good luck.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Staphyla.</i> Here in our house there’s nothing else for thieves to
gain, so filled is it with emptiness and cobwebs.</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> You hag of hags, I choose those cobwebs to be watched
for me.<a id="Marker_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="marker">1148</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A superstition prevails among us that if a Spider approaches,
either by crawling toward or descending from
the ceiling to a person, it forebodes good to such person;
and, on the contrary, if the Spider runs hurriedly away, it
is an omen of bad luck. But if the Spider be a poisonous
one, or a Fly-catcher, and it approaches you, some evil is
about to befall you, which to avert you must cross your
heart thrice.</p>

<p>If you kill a Spider crossing your path, you will have
bad luck.</p>

<p>A Spider should not be killed in your house, but out of
doors; if in the house, our country people say you are
“pulling down your house.”</p>

<p>If a Spider drops down from its web or from a tree directly
in front of a person, such person will see before night
a dear friend.</p>

<p>A variety of this superstition is, that, if the Spider be
white, it foretells the acquaintance of a friend; and if black,
an enemy.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, a Spider seen in the morning forebodes
good luck; in the afternoon, bad luck.<a id="Marker_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="marker">1149</a></p>

<p>There is a common saying at Winchester, England, that
no Spider will hang its web on the roof of Irish oak in the
chapel or cloisters;<a id="Marker_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="marker">1150</a> and the cicerone, who shows the cathedral
church at St. David’s, points out to the visitor that the
choir is roofed with Irish oak, which does not harbor Spiders,
though cobwebs are plentifully seen in other parts of the
cathedral.<a id="Marker_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="marker">1151</a> This superstition (for it certainly is nothing
more)<a id="Marker_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="marker">1152</a> probably originated with the old story of St. Patrick’s
having exorcised and banished all kinds of vermin
from Ireland.</p>

<p>The same virtue of repelling Spiders is attributed also to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_341" title="341"></a><!--342.png-->
chestnut and cedar wood;<a id="Marker_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="marker">1153</a> and the old roof at Turner’s
Court, in Gloucestershire, four miles from Bath, which is of
chestnut, is said to be perfectly free from cobwebs;<a id="Marker_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="marker">1154</a> hence
also are the cloisters of New College, and of Christ’s
Church, in England, roofed with chestnut.<a id="Marker_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="marker">1155</a></p>

<p>A small Spider of a red color, called a Tainct in England,
is accounted, by the country people, a deadly poison
to cows and horses; so when any of their cattle die suddenly
and swell up, to account for their deaths, they say
they have “licked a Tainct.” Browne thinks this is, most
probably, but a vulgar error.<a id="Marker_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="marker">1156</a></p>

<p>It is a very ancient and curious belief that there exists
a remarkable enmity between the Spider and serpents,<a id="Marker_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="marker">1157</a> and
more especially between the Spider and the toad; and many
curious stories are told of the combats between these animals.
The following, related by Erasmus, which he asserts
he had directly from one of the spectators, is probably the
most remarkable, and we insert it in the words of Dr. James:
“A person (a monk)<a id="Marker_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="marker">1158</a> lying along upon the floor of his
chamber in the summer-time to sleep in a supine posture,
when a toad, creeping out of some green rushes, brought
just before in to adorn the chimney, gets upon his face and
with his feet sits across his lips. To force off the toad, says
the historian, would have been accounted death to the
sleeper; and to leave her there, very cruel and dangerous;
so that upon consultation, it was concluded to find out a Spider,
which, together with her web and the window she was
fastened to, was brought carefully, and so contrived as to be
held perpendicularly to the man’s face; which was no sooner
done but the Spider, discovering his enemy, let himself down
and struck in his dart, afterward betaking himself up again
to his web: the toad swelled, but as yet kept his station.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_342" title="342"></a><!--343.png-->
The second wound is given quickly after by the Spider,
upon which he swells yet more, but remained alive still.
The Spider, coming down again by his thread, gives the
third blow, and the toad, taking off his feet from over the
man’s mouth, fell off dead.”<a id="Marker_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="marker">1159</a></p>

<p>The following cosmogony is found in the sacred writings
of the Pundits of India: A certain immense Spider was the
origin, the first cause of all things; which, drawing the matter
from its own bowels, wove the web of this universe, and
disposed it with wonderful art; she, in the mean time, sitting
in the center of her work, feels and directs the motion of
every part, till at length, when she has pleased herself sufficiently
in ordering and contemplating this web, she draws
all the threads she had spun out again into herself; and,
having absorbed them, the universal nature of all creatures
vanishes into nothing.<a id="Marker_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="marker">1160</a></p>

<p>Among the Chululahs of our western coast, Capt. Stuart
informs me there is a vague superstition that the Spider is
connected with the origin of the world. To what extent
this curious notion prevails, or anything more concerning it,
I have been unable to learn.</p>

<p>The natives of Guinea, says Bosman, believe that the first
men were created by the large black Spider, which is so common
in their country, and called in their jargon “Ananse;”
nor is there any reasoning, continues this traveler, a great
number of them out of it.<a id="Marker_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="marker">1161</a> Barbot also remarks that, in the
belief of the Guinea negroes, the black Ananse created the
first man.<a id="Marker_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="marker">1162</a></p>

<p>That the Spider should be connected with the origin of the
world and man in the several beliefs of the Hindoos, Chululahs,
and negroes, races so widely different and separated
from one another, is a coincidence most remarkable.</p>

<p>A large and hideous species of Spider, said to be only
found in the palace of Hampton Court, England, is known
by the name of the “Cardinals.” This name has been given
them from a superstitious belief that the spirits of Cardinal
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_343" title="343"></a><!--344.png-->
Wolsey and his retinue still haunt the palace in their
shape.<a id="Marker_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="marker">1163</a></p>

<p>In running across the carpet in an evening, with the
shade cast from their large bodies by the light of the lamp
or candle, these “Cardinals” have been mistaken for mice,
and have occasioned no little alarm to some of the more
nervous inhabitants of the palace.<a id="Marker_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="marker">1164</a></p>

<p>The story of the gigantic Spider found in the Church of
St. Eustace, at Paris, in Chambers’ Miscellany, is related as
follows: It is told that the sexton of this church was surprised
at very often discovering a certain lamp extinguished
in the morning, notwithstanding it had been duly replenished
with oil the preceding evening. Curious to learn the cause
of this mysterious circumstance, he kept watch several evenings,
and was at last gratified by the discovery. During the
night he observed a Spider, of enormous dimensions, come
down the chain by which the lamp was suspended, drink up
the oil, and, when gorged to satiety, slowly retrace its steps
to a recess in the fretwork above. A similar Spider is said
to have been found, in 1751, in the cathedral church of Milan.
It was observed to feed also on oil. When killed, it
weighed four pounds! and was afterward sent to the imperial
museum at Vienna.<a id="Marker_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="marker">1165</a></p>

<p>The following remarkable anecdote is translated from the
French: “M.&nbsp;F&mdash;&mdash; de Saint Omer laid on the chimney-piece
of his chamber, one evening on going to bed, a small
shirt-pin of gold, the head of which represented a fly. Next
day, M.&nbsp;F&mdash;&mdash; would have taken his pin from the place
where he had put it, but the trinket had disappeared. A
servant-maid, who had only been in M.&nbsp;F&mdash;&mdash;’s service a
few days, was solely suspected of having carried off the pin,
and sent away. But, at length, M.&nbsp;F&mdash;&mdash;’s sister, putting up
some curtains, was very much surprised to find the lost pin
suspended from the ceiling in a Spider’s web! And thus
was the disappearance of the <i>bijou</i> explained: A Spider,
deceived by the figure of the fly which the pin presented, had
drawn it into his web.”<a id="Marker_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="marker">1166</a></p>

<p>In the Treasvrie of Avncient and Moderne Times, it is
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_344" title="344"></a><!--345.png-->
stated that “Spiders do shun all such wals as run to ruine,
or are like to be ouerthrowne.”<a id="Marker_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="marker">1167</a></p>

<p>A Spider hanging from a tree is said to have made both
Turenne and Gustavus Adolphus shudder!<a id="Marker_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="marker">1168</a></p>

<p>M. Zimmerman relates the following instance of antipathy
to Spiders: “Being one day in an English company,” says
he, “consisting of persons of distinction, the conversation
happened to fall on antipathies. The greater part of the
company denied the reality of them, and treated them as
old women’s tales; but I told them that antipathy was a
real disease. Mr. William Matthew, son of the Governor
of Barbados, was of my opinion, and, as he added that he
himself had an extreme antipathy to Spiders, he was laughed
at by the whole company. I showed them, however, that
this was a real impression of his mind, resulting from a
mechanical effect. Mr. John Murray, afterward Duke of
Athol, took it into his head to make, in Mr. Matthew’s presence,
a Spider of black wax, to try whether this antipathy
would appear merely on the sight of the insect. He went
out of the room, therefore, and returned with a bit of black
wax in his hand, which he kept shut. Mr. Matthew, who
in other respects was a sedate and amiable man, imagining
that his friend really held a Spider, immediately drew his
sword in a great fury, retired with precipitation to the wall,
leaned against it, as if to run him through, and sent forth
horrible cries. All the muscles of his face were swelled, his
eye-balls rolled in their sockets, and his whole body was as
stiff as a post. We immediately ran to him in great alarm,
and took his sword from him, assuring him at the same time
that Mr. Murray had nothing in his hand but a bit of wax,
and that he himself might see it on the table where it was
placed. He remained some time in this spasmodic state,
and I was really afraid of the consequences. He, however,
gradually recovered, and deplored the dreadful passion into
which he had been thrown, and from which he still suffered.
His pulse was exceedingly quick and full, and his whole body
was covered with a cold sweat. After taking a sedative, he
was restored to his former tranquillity, and his agitation
was attended with no other bad consequences.”<a id="Marker_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="marker">1169</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_345" title="345"></a><!--346.png-->

<p>In Batavia, New York, on the evening of the 13th of
September, 1834, Hon. David E. Evans, agent of the Holland
Land Company, discovered in his wine-cellar a live
striped snake, about nine inches in length, suspended between
two shelves, by the tail, by Spiders’ web. From the
shelves being two feet apart, and the position of the web,
the witnesses were of opinion the snake could not have
fallen by accident into it, and thus have become inextricably
entangled, but that it had been actually captured, and drawn
up so that its head could not reach the shelf below by about
an inch, by Spiders, and of a species much smaller than the
common fly, three of which at night were seen feeding upon
it, while it was yet alive.</p>

<p>Hon. S. Cummings, first Judge of the Court of Common
Pleas in his county, and also Postmaster of Batavia, and Mr.
D. Lyman Beecher have described this phenomenon, and
given the names of quite a number of gentlemen who witnessed
it, and will testify to the accuracy of their accounts.
Says Mr. Cummings: “Upon a critical examination through
a magnifying glass, the following curious facts appeared.
The mouth of the snake was fast tied up, by a great number
of threads, wound around it so tight that he could not run
out his tongue. His tail was tied in a knot, so as to leave
a small loop, or ring, through which the cord was fastened;
and the end of the tail, above this loop, to the length of
something over half an inch, was lashed fast to the cord, to
keep it from slipping. As the snake hung, the length of the
cord, from his tail to the focus to which it was fastened, was
about six inches; and a little above the tail, there was observed
a round ball, about the size of a pea. Upon inspection,
this appeared to be a green fly, around which the cord
had been wound as a windlass, with which the snake had
been hauled up; and a great number of threads were
fastened to the cord above, and to the rolling side of this
ball to keep it from unwinding, and letting the snake down.
The cord, therefore, must have been extended from the focus
of this web to the shelf below where the snake was lying
when first captured; and being made fast to the loop in his
tail, the fly was carried and fastened about midway to the
side of the cord. And then by rolling this fly over and over,
it wound the cord around it, both from above and below, until
the snake was raised to the proper height, and then was
fastened, as before mentioned.</p>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_346" title="346"></a><!--347.png-->

<p>“In this situation the suffering snake hung, alive, and
furnished a continued feast for several large Spiders, until
Saturday forenoon, the 16th, when some persons, by playing
with him, broke the web above the focus, so as to let part of
his body rest upon the shelf below. In this situation he
lingered, the Spiders taking no notice of him, until Thursday,
eight days after he was discovered, when some large
ants were found devouring his body.”<a id="Marker_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="marker">1170</a></p>

<p>At a recent meeting of the Academy of Natural Sciences,
Philadelphia, Mr. Lesley read the following extract from a
letter written by Mr. E.&nbsp;A. Spring, of Eagleswood, N.&nbsp;J.:</p>

<p>“I was over on the South Amboy shore with a friend,
walking in a swampy wood, where a dyke was made, some
three feet wide, when we discovered in the middle of this
ditch a large black Spider making very queer motions for a
Spider, and, on examination, it proved that he had <i>caught
a fish</i>.</p>

<p>“He was biting the fish, just on the forward side of the
dorsal fin, with a deadly gripe, and the poor fish was swimming
round and round slowly, or twisting its body as if in
pain. The head of its black enemy was sometimes almost
pulled under water, but never entirely, for the fish did not
seem to have had enough strength, but moved its fins as if
exhausted, and often rested. At last it swam under a floating
leaf at the shore, and appeared to be trying, by going
under that, to scrape off the Spider, but without effect.
They then got close to the bank, when suddenly the long
black legs of the Spider came up out of the water, where
they had possibly been embracing a fish (I have seen Spiders
seize flies with all their legs at once), reached out behind, and
fastened upon the irregularities of the side of the ditch. The
Spider then commenced tugging to get his prize up the bank.
My friend stayed to watch them, while I went to the nearest
house for a wide-mouthed bottle. During the six or eight
minutes that I was away, the Spider had drawn the fish entirely
out of the water, when they had both fallen in again,
the bank being nearly perpendicular. There had been a
great struggle; and now, on my return, the fish was already
hoisted head first more than half his length out on the land.
The fish was very much exhausted, hardly making any movement,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_347" title="347"></a><!--348.png-->
and the Spider had evidently gained the victory, and
was slowly and steadily tugging him up. He had not once
quitted his hold during the quarter to half an hour that we
had watched them. He held, with his head toward the
fish’s tail, and pulled him up at an angle of forty-five degrees
by stepping backward.… The Spider was three-fourths
of an inch long, and weighed fourteen grains; the
fish was three and one-fourth inches long, and weighed
sixty-six grains.”<a id="Marker_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="marker">1171</a></p>

<p>The following interesting account of the rarely-witnessed
phenomenon of a shower of webs of the Gossamer-spider,
<i>Aranea obtextrix</i>, is given us by Mr. White: “On the
21st of September, 1741, being intent on field diversions, I
rose,” says this gentleman, “before daybreak; when I came
into the enclosures, I found the stubbles and clover grounds
matted all over with a thick coat of cobweb, in the meshes
of which a copious and heavy dew hung so plentifully, that
the whole face of the country seemed, as it were, covered
with two or three setting-nets, drawn one over another.
When the dogs attempted to hunt, their eyes were so
blinded and hood-winked that they could not proceed, but
were obliged to lie down and scrape the incumbrances from
their faces with their fore-feet.… As the morning advanced,
the sun became bright and warm, and the day turned
out one of the most lovely ones which no season but the
autumn produces; cloudless, calm, serene, and worthy of
the south of France itself.</p>

<p>“About nine an appearance very unusual began to demand
our attention, a shower of cobwebs falling from very elevated
regions, and continuing, without any interruption, till the
close of the day. These webs were not single filmy threads,
floating in the air in all directions, but perfect flakes of rags;
some near an inch broad, and five or six long. On every
side, as the observer turned his eyes, might he behold a
continual succession of fresh flakes falling into his sight,
and twinkling like stars.”<a id="Marker_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="marker">1172</a></p>

<p>The Times of October 9th, 1826, records another shower
of gossamer as follows: “On Sunday, Oct. 1st, 1826, a phenomenon
of rare occurrence in the neighborhood of Liverpool
was observed in that vicinage, and for many miles distant,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_348" title="348"></a><!--349.png-->
especially at Wigan. The fields and roads were
covered with a light filmy substance, which, by many persons,
was mistaken for cotton; although they might have
been convinced of their error, as staple cotton does not exceed
a few inches in length, while the filaments seen in such
incredible quantities extended as many yards. In walking
in the fields the shoes were completely covered with it, and
its floating fibres came in contact with the face in all directions.
Every tree, lamp-post, or other projecting body had
arrested a portion of it. It profusely descended at Wigan
like a sleet, and in such quantities as to affect the appearance
of the atmosphere. On examination it was found to
contain small flies, some of which were so diminutive as to
require a magnifying glass to render them perceptible. The
substance so abundant in quantity, was the gossamer of the
garden, or field Spider, often met with in fine weather in
the country, and of which, according to Buffon, it would
take 663,552 Spiders to produce a single pound.”<a id="Marker_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="marker">1173</a></p>

<p>“In the yeare that L. Paulus and C. Marcellus were
Consuls,” says Pliny, “it rained wool about the castle Carissa,
neare to which a yeare after, T. Annius Milo was
slaine.”<a id="Marker_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="marker">1174</a> This rain of wool was doubtless a shower of gossamer.</p>

<p>It was an old and strange notion that the gossamer webs
were composed of dew burned by the sun. Says Spenser:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">More subtle web Arachne cannot spin;</div>
<div class="line">Nor <i>the fine nets</i>, which oft we woven see,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Thomson also:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p>Likewise Blackmore:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Henry More also mentions this old belief; but suspected,
however, the true origin and use of the filmy threads:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">As light and thin as <i>cobwebs</i> that do fly</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Jamieson, in his Scottish Dictionary, gives <i>sun-dew webs</i>
as a name given in the South of Scotland to the gossamer.</p>

<p>The Swedes call a cobweb <i>dwaergsnaet</i>, from <i>dwaerg</i>, a
species of malevolent fairy or demon; very ingenious, and
supposed often to assume the appearance of a Spider, and
to form these nets. The peasants of that country say,
<i>Jorden naetjar sig</i>, “the earth covers itself with a net,”
when the whole surface of the ground is covered with gossamer,
which, it is commonly believed, indicates the seedtime.<a id="Marker_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="marker">1180</a></p>

<p>Voss, in a note on his Luise (iii. 17), says that the
popular belief in Germany is, that the gossamers are woven
by the Dwarfs. Keightley thinks the word gossamer is a
corruption of <i>gorse</i>, or <i>goss samyt</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>samyt</i>, or finely-woven
silken web that lies on the <i>gorse</i> or furze.<a id="Marker_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="marker">1181</a></p>

<p>A learned man and good natural philosopher, and one of
the first Fellows of the Royal Society, Robert Hooke, the
author of <i>Micrographia</i>, gravely remarked in his scientific
disquisition on the gossamer, that it “was not unlikely, but
those great white clouds, that appear all the summer time,
may be of the same substance!!”<a id="Marker_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="marker">1182</a></p>

<p>The following well-authenticated incident is told by Turner
as having occurred when he was a young practitioner:
A certain young woman was accustomed, when she went
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_350" title="350"></a><!--351.png-->
into the vault after night, to go Spider-hunting, as she
called it, setting fire to the webs of Spiders, and burning
the insects with the flame of the candle. It happened at
length, however, after this whimsey had been indulged a
long time, one of the persecuted Spiders sold its life much
dearer than those hundreds she had destroyed, and most
effectually cured her of her idle cruel practice; for, in the
words of Dr. James, “lighting upon the melted tallow of
her candle, near the flame, and his legs becoming entangled
therein, so that he could not extricate himself, the flame or
heat coming on, he was made a sacrifice to his cruel persecutor,
who, delighting her eyes with the spectacle, still
waiting for the flame to take hold of him, he presently
burst with a great crack, and threw his liquor, some into
her eyes, but mostly upon her lips; by means of which,
flinging away her candle, she cried out for help, as fancying
herself killed already with the poison.” In the night the
woman’s lips swelled excessively, and one of her eyes was
much inflamed. Her gums and tongue were also affected,
and a continual vomiting attended. For several days she
suffered the greatest pain, but was finally cured by an old
woman with a preparation of plantain leaves and cobwebs
applied to the eyes, and taken inwardly two or three times
a day.</p>

<p>Before this accident happened to her, this woman asserted
that the smell of the Spiders burning oftentimes so affected
her head, that objects about her seemed to turn round; she
grew faint also with cold sweats, and sometimes a light
vomiting followed, yet so great was her delight in tormenting
these creatures, and driving them from their webs, that
she could not forbear, till she met with the above narrated
accident.<a id="Marker_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="marker">1183</a></p>

<p>A similar story is related by Nic. Nicholas of a man he
saw at his hotel in Florence, who, burning a large black
Spider in the flame of a candle, and staying for some time
in the same room, from the fumes arising, grew feeble, and
fell into a fainting fit, suffering all night great palpitation
at the heart, and afterward a pulse so very low as to be
scarcely felt.<a id="Marker_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="marker">1184</a></p>

<p>Several monks, in a monastery in Florence, are said to
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_351" title="351"></a><!--352.png-->
have died from the effects of drinking wine from a vessel in
which there was afterward found a drowned Spider.<a id="Marker_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="marker">1185</a></p>

<p>There are two animals to which the Italians give the
name Tarantula: the one is a species of Lizard, whose bite
is reputed mortal, found about Fondi, Cajeta, and Capua;
the other is a large Spider, found in the fields in several
parts of Italy, and especially at Tarentum&mdash;hence the name.
“Such as are stung by this creature (the <i>Aranea Tarantula</i>),”
says Misson, “make a thousand different gestures in a moment;
for they weep, dance, tremble, laugh, grow pale, cry,
swoon away, and, after a few days of torment, expire, if
they be not assisted in time. They find some relief by
sweating and antidotes, but <i>music</i> is the great and specific
remedy. A learned gentleman of unquestionable credit told
me at Rome, that he had been twice a witness both of the
disease and of the cure. They are both attended with circumstances
that seem very strange; but the matter of fact
is well attested, and undeniable.”<a id="Marker_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="marker">1186</a> Such is the story generally
told, believed, and unquestioned, that has found its
way into the works of many learned travelers and naturalists,
but which is without the slightest shadow of truth.</p>

<p>“I think I could produce,” continues the deluded Misson,
“natural and easy reasons to explain this effect of music;
but without engaging myself in a dissertation that would
carry me too far, I shall content myself with relating some
other instances of the same kind: Every one knows the
efficacy of David’s harp to restore Saul to the use of his
reason. I remember Lewis Guyon, in his Lessons, has a
story of a lady of his acquaintance, who lived one hundred
and six years without ever using any other remedy than
music; for which purpose she allowed a salary to a certain
musician, whom she called her physician; and I might add
that I was particularly acquainted with a gentleman, very
much subject to the gout, who infallibly received ease, and
sometimes was wholly freed from his pains by a loud noise.
He used to make all his servants come into his chamber,
and beat with all their force upon the table and floor; and
the noise they made, in conjunction with the sound of the
violin, was his sovereign remedy.”<a id="Marker_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="marker">1187</a></p>

<p>In the Treasvrie of Avncient and Moderne Times, printed
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_352" title="352"></a><!--353.png-->
in London, the year 1619, we find the following: “<i>Alexander
Alexandrinus</i> proceedeth farther, affirming that he
beheld one wounded by this Spider, to dance and leape
about incessantly, and the Musitians (finding themselves
wearied) gave over playing: whereupon, the poore offended
dancer, hauing vtterly lost all his forces, fell downe on the
ground, as if he had bene dead. The Musitians no sooner
began to playe againe, but hee returned to himselfe, and
mounting vp vpon his feet, danced againe as lustily as
formerly hee had done, and so continued dancing still, til
hee found the harme asswaged, and himselfe entirely recovered.
Heereunto he addeth, that when it hath happened,
that a man hath not beene thorowly cured by Musique
in this manner; within some short while after, hearing
the sound of Instruments, hee hath recouered footing
againe, and bene enforced to hold on dancing, and never to
ceasse, till his perfect and absolute healing, which (questionlesse)
is admirable in nature.”<a id="Marker_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="marker">1188</a></p>

<p>Robert Boyle, in his Usefulness of Natural Philosophy,
among other stories of the power of music upon those bitten
by Tarantulas, mentions the following: “<i>Epiphanius
Ferdinandus</i> himself not only tells us of a man of 94 years
of age, and weak, that he could not go, unless supported
by his staff, who did, upon the hearing of musick after he
was bitten, immediately fall a dancing and capering like a
kid; and affirms that Tarantulas themselves may be brought
to leap and dance at the sound of lutes, small drums, bagpipes,
fiddles, etc.; but challenges those, that believe them
not, to come and try, promising them an occular conviction:
and adds what is very memorable and pleasant, that not
only men, in whom much may be ascribed to fancy, but
other animals being bitten, may likewise, by musick, be reduced
to leap or dance: for he saith, he saw a Wasp, which
being bitten by a Tarantula, whilst a lutanist chanced to
be by; the musician, playing upon his instrument gave
them the sport of seeing both the Wasp and Spider begin
to dance: Annexing, that a bitten Cock did the like.”<a id="Marker_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="marker">1189</a></p>

<p>In an Italian nobleman’s palace, Skippon saw a fellow
who was bitten by a Tarantula; “he danced,” says this
traveler, “very antickly, with naked swords, to a tune played
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_353" title="353"></a><!--354.png-->
on an instrument.” The Italians say that if the Spider be
immediately killed, no such effects will appear; but as long
as it lives, the person bitten is subject to these paroxysms,
and when it dies he is free. Skippon says that usually they
are the poorer sort of people who say they are bitten, and
they beg money while they are in these dancing fits.<a id="Marker_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="marker">1190</a></p>

<p>Bell was informed at Buzabbatt (in Persia) that the celebrated
Kashan Tarantula “neither stings nor bites, but
drops its venom upon the skin, which is of such a nature
that it immediately penetrates into the body, and causes
dreadful symptoms; such as giddiness of the head, a violent
pain in the stomach, and a lethargic stupefaction. The
remedy is the application of the same animal when braised
to the part affected, by which the poison is extracted. They
also make the patient,” continues this traveler, “drink abundance
of sweet milk, after which he is put in a kind of tray,
suspended by ropes fixed in the four corners; it is turned
round till the ropes are twisted hard together, and, when let
go at once, the untwining causes the basket to run round
with a quick motion, which forces the patient to vomit.”<a id="Marker_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="marker">1191</a></p>

<p>Skippon was shown by Corvino, in his Museum at Rome,
“a <i>Tarantula Apula</i>, which he kept some time alive; and
the poison of it, he said, broke two glasses.”<a id="Marker_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="marker">1192</a></p>

<p>In the Treasvrie of Avncient and Moderne Times, it is
stated of “Harts, that when they are bitten or stung by a
venomous kinde of Spiders, called <i>phalanges;</i> they heale
themselves by eating <i>Creuisses</i>, though others do hold, that
it is by an Hearb growing in the water.”<a id="Marker_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="marker">1193</a></p>

<p>Diodorus Siculus tells as that there border upon the
country of the Acridophagi a large tract of land, rich in
fair pastures, but desert and uninhabited; not that there
were never any people there, but that formerly, when it was
inhabited, an immoderate rain fell, which bred a vast host
of Spiders and Scorpions: that these implacable enemies of
the country increased so, that though at first the whole nation
attempted to destroy them (for he who was bitten or
stung by them, immediately fell dead), so that, not knowing
where to remain, or how to get food, they were forced to fly
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_354" title="354"></a><!--355.png-->
to some other place for relief.<a id="Marker_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="marker">1194</a> Strabo has inserted also this
miraculous story in his Geography.<a id="Marker_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="marker">1195</a></p>

<p>Mr. Nichols mentions Spiders as having been embroidered
on the white gowns of ladies in the time of Queen Elizabeth.<a id="Marker_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="marker">1196</a></p>

<p>Sloane tells us the housekeepers of Jamaica keep large
Spiders in their houses to kill cockroaches.<a id="Marker_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="marker">1197</a></p>

<p>Captain Dampier, after minutely describing in his quaint
way the “teeth” of a “sort of Spider, some near as big as
a Man’s Fist,” which are found in the West Indies, says:
“These Teeth we often preserve. Some wear them in their
Tobacco-pouches to pick their Pipes. Others preserve them
for tooth-pickers, especially such as are troubled with the
toothache; for by report they will expell that Pain.”<a id="Marker_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="marker">1198</a> These
teeth, which are of a finely polished substance, extremely
hard, and of a bright shining black, are often, in the Bermudas,
for these qualities set in silver or gold and used also
for tooth-picks.<a id="Marker_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="marker">1199</a></p>

<p>Dr. Sparrman says that Spiders form an article of the
Bushman’s dainties;<a id="Marker_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="marker">1200</a> and Labillardiere tells us that the inhabitants
of New Caledonia seek for and eat with avidity
large quantities of a Spider nearly an inch long (which he
calls <i>Aranea edulis</i>) and which they roast over the fire.<a id="Marker_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="marker">1201</a>
Spiders are also eaten by the American Indians and Australians.<a id="Marker_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="marker">1202</a>
Molien says: “The people of Maniana, south of
Gambia and Senegal, are cannibals. They eat Spiders,
Beetles, and old men.”<a id="Marker_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="marker">1203</a> In Siam, also, we learn from Turpin,
the egg-bags of Spiders are considered a delicate food.
The bags of certain poisonous species which make holes in
the ground in the woods are preferred.<a id="Marker_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="marker">1204</a></p>

<p>And Peter Martyr, in his History of the West Indies,
makes the following statement: “The Chiribichenses (Caribbeans)
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_355" title="355"></a><!--356.png-->
eate Spiders, Frogges, and whatsoever woormes, and
lice also without loathing, although in other thinges they
are so queasie stomaked, that if they see anything that doth
not like them, they presently cast upp whatsoever is in their
stomacke.”<a id="Marker_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="marker">1205</a></p>

<p>Reaumur tells us of a young lady who when she walked
in her grounds never saw a Spider that she did not take and
eat upon the spot.<a id="Marker_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="marker">1206</a> Another female, the celebrated Anna
Maria Schurman, used to crack them between her teeth like
nuts, which she affirmed they much resembled in taste, excusing
her propensity by saying that she was born under
the sign Scorpio.<a id="Marker_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="marker">1207</a> “When Alexander reigned, it is reported
that there was a very beautiful strumpet in Alexandria, that
fed alwayes from her childhood on Spiders, and for that reason
the king was admonished that he should be very carefull
not to embrace her, lest he should be poysoned by venome
that might evaporate from her by sweat. Albertus Magnus
also makes mention of a certain noble mayd of Collen, that
was fed with Spiders from her childhood. And we in England
have a great lady yet living, who will not leave off eating
of them. And Phaerus, a physician, did often eat them
without any hurt at all.”<a id="Marker_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="marker">1208</a></p>

<p>La Lande, the celebrated French astronomer, we are told
by Disjonval, ate as delicacies Spiders and Caterpillars.
He boasted of this as a philosophic trait of character, that
he could raise himself above dislikes and prejudices; and,
to cure Madame Lepaute of a very annoying fear of, and
antipathy to Spiders, it is said he gradually habituated her
to look upon them, to touch, and finally to swallow them as
readily as he himself.<a id="Marker_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="marker">1209</a></p>

<p>A German, immortalized by Rösel, used to eat Spiders
by handfuls, and spread them upon his bread like butter,
observing that he found them very useful, “<i>um sich auszulaxiren</i>.”<a id="Marker_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="marker">1210</a></p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_356" title="356"></a><!--357.png-->

<p>The satirist, Peter Pindar, records the same of Sir Joshua
Banks:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">How early Genius shows itself at times,</div>
<div class="line">Thus Pope, the prince of poets, lisped in rhymes,</div>
<div class="line">And our Sir Joshua Banks, most strange to utter,</div>
<div class="line i2">  To whom each cockroach-eater is a fool,</div>
<div class="line i2">  Did, when a very little boy at school,</div>
<div class="line">Eat Spiders, spread upon his bread and butter.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Conradus, bishop of Constance, at the sacrament of the
Lord’s Supper, drank off a Spider that had fallen into his
cup of wine, while he was busied in the consecration of the
elements; “yet did he not receive the least hurt or damage
thereby.”<a id="Marker_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="marker">1211</a></p>

<p>We learn from Poggio, the Florentine, that Zisca, the
great and victorious reformer of Bohemia, was such an epicure,
that he only asked for, as his share of the plunder, what
he was pleased to call “the cobwebs, which hung from the
roofs of the farmers’ houses.” It is said, however, that this
was but one of his witty circumlocutions to express the hams,
sausages, and pig-cheeks, for which Bohemia has always
been celebrated.<a id="Marker_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="marker">1212</a></p>

<p>For the bite of all Spiders, according to Pliny, the best
remedies are “a cock’s brains, taken in oxycrate with a little
pepper; five ants, swallowed in drink; sheep’s dung applied
in vinegar; and Spiders of any kind, left to putrify
in oil.”<a id="Marker_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="marker">1213</a> Another proper remedy, says this writer, is, “to
present before the eyes of a person stung another Spider of
the same description, a purpose for which they are preserved
when found dead. Their husks also,” he continues, “found
in a dry state, are beaten up and taken in drink for a similar
purpose. The young of the weasel, too, are possessed of a
similar property.”<a id="Marker_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="marker">1214</a></p>

<p>Among the remedies given by Pliny for diseases of eyes,
is mentioned “the cobweb of the common fly-Spider, that
which lines its hole more particularly. This,” he continues,
“applied to the forehead across the temples, in a compress
of some kind or other, is said to be marvellously useful for
the cure of defluxions of the eyes; the web must be taken,
however, and applied by the hands of a boy who has not
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_357" title="357"></a><!--358.png-->
arrived at the years of puberty; the boy, too, must not
show himself to the patient for three days, and during those
three days neither of them must touch the ground with his
feet uncovered. The white Spider with very elongated,
thin legs, beaten up in old oil, forms an ointment which is
used for the cure of albugo. The Spider, too, whose web,
of remarkable thickness, is generally found adhering to the
rafters of houses, applied in a piece of cloth, is said to be
curative of defluxions of the eyes.”<a id="Marker_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="marker">1215</a></p>

<p>As a remedy for the ears, Pliny says: “The thick pulp of
a Spider’s body, mixed with oil of roses, is used for the
ears; or else the pulp applied by itself with saffron or in
wool.”<a id="Marker_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="marker">1216</a></p>

<p>For fractures of the cranium, Pliny says, cobwebs are
applied, with oil and vinegar; the application never coming
away till a cure has been effected. Cobwebs are good, too,
he continues, for stopping the bleeding of wounds made in
shaving.<a id="Marker_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="marker">1217</a> They are still used for this purpose, as also the
fur from articles made of beaver.</p>

<p>In Ben Jonson’s Stable of News, Almanac says of old
Penny boy (as a skit upon his penuriousness), that he</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Sweeps down no cobwebs here,</div>
<div class="line">But sells ’em for cut fingers; and the Spiders,</div>
<div class="line">As creatures rear’d of dust, and cost him nothing,</div>
<div class="line">To fat old ladies’ monkies.<a id="Marker_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="marker">1218</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Shakspeare, in his Midsummer-Night’s Dream,
makes Bottom say to the fairy Cobweb:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good master Cobweb.
If I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you.”<a id="Marker_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="marker">1219</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pills formed of Spiders’ webs are still considered an infallible
cure for the ague.<a id="Marker_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="marker">1220</a> Dr. Graham, in his Domestic
Medicine, prescribes it for ague and intermittent fever. And
Spiders themselves, with their legs pinched off, and then
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_358" title="358"></a><!--359.png-->
powdered with flour, so as to resemble a pill, are also sometimes
given for ague.<a id="Marker_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="marker">1221</a> Dr. Chapman, of Philadelphia, states
that in doses of five grains of Spiders’ web, repeated every
fourth or fifth hour, he has cured some obstinate intermittents,
suspended the paroxysms of hectic, overcome morbid
vigilance from excessive nervous mobility, and quieted irritation
of the system from various causes, and not less as connected
with protracted coughs and other chronic pectoral
affections.<a id="Marker_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="marker">1222</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Delany, in a letter dated March 1st, 1743&ndash;4, gives
two infallible recipes for ague.</p>

<p>1st. Pounded ginger, made into paste with brandy, spread
on sheep’s leather, and a plaister of it laid over the navel.</p>

<p>2d. A Spider put into a goose-quill, well sealed and secured,
and hung about the child’s neck as low as the pit of
its stomach.</p>

<p>Upon this Lady Llanover notes: “Although the prescription
of the Spider in the quill will probably create
amusement, considered as an old charm, yet there is no
doubt of the medicinal virtues of Spiders and their webs,
which have been long known to the Celtic inhabitants of
Great Britain and Ireland.”<a id="Marker_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="marker">1223</a></p>

<p>The above mentioned Dr. Graham states that he has
known of a Spider having been sewed up in a rag and worn
as a periapt round the neck to charm away the ague.<a id="Marker_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="marker">1224</a></p>

<p>In the Netherlands, it is thought good for an ague, to inclose
a Spider between the two halves of a nut-shell, and
wear it about the neck.<a id="Marker_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="marker">1225</a></p>

<p>“In the diary of Elias Ashmole, 11th April, 1681, is preserved
the following curious incident: ‘I took early in the
morning a good dose of elixir, and hung three Spiders about
my neck, and they drove my ague away. Deo gratias!’
Ashmole was a judicial astrologer, and the patron of the
renowned Mr. Lilly. Par nobile fratrum.”<a id="Marker_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="marker">1226</a></p>

<p>“Among the approved Remedies of Sir Matthew Lister, I
find,” says Dr. James, “that the distilled water of black
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_359" title="359"></a><!--360.png-->
Spiders is an excellent cure for wounds, and that this was
one of the choice secrets of Sir Walter Raleigh.…</p>

<p>“The Spider is said to avert the paroxisms of fevers, if
it be applied to the pulse of the wrist, or the temples; but
it is peculiarly recommended against a quartan, being enclosed
in the shell of a hazlenut.…</p>

<p>“The Spider, which some call the catcher, or wolf, being
beaten into a plaister, then sewed up in linen, and applied to
the forehead and temples, prevents the return of the tertian.…
There is another kind of Spider, which spins a white,
fine, and thick web. One of this sort, wrapped in leather,
and hung about the arm, will, it is said, avert the fit of a
quartan. Boiled in oil of roses, and distilled into the ears,
it eases (says Dioscorides, ii. 68) pains in those parts.…</p>

<p>“The country people have a tradition, that a small quantity
of Spiders’ web, given about an hour before the fit of an
ague, and repeated immediately before it, is effectual in curing
that troublesome, and sometimes obstinate distemper.…
The Indians about North Carolina have great dependence
on this remedy for ague, to which they are much
subject.”<a id="Marker_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="marker">1227</a></p>

<p>“Of the cod or bags of Spiders, M. Bon caused a sort of
drops to be made, in imitation of those of Goddard, because
they contain a great quantity of volatile salt.”<a id="Marker_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="marker">1228</a></p>

<p>Moufet, in Theatrum Insectorum, has the following:
“Also that knotty whip of God, and mock of all physicians,
the Gowt, which learned men say can be cured by no remedy,
findes help and cure by a Spider layed on, if it be taken at
that time when neither sun nor moon shine, and the hinder
legs pulled off, and put into a deer’s skin and bound to the
pained foot, and be left on it for some time. Also for the
most part we finde those people to be free from the gowt of
hands or feet (which few medicaments can doe), in whose
houses the Spiders breed much, and doth beautifie them with
her tapestry and hangings.… Our chirurgeons cure
warts thus: They wrap a Spider’s ordinary web into the
fashion of a ball, and laying it on the wart, they set it on
fire, and so let it burn to ashes; by this means the wart is
rooted out by the roots, and will never grow again.…
I cannot but repeat a history that I formerly heard from
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_360" title="360"></a><!--361.png-->
our dear friend worthy to be believed, Bruerus. A lustfull
nephew of his, having spent his estate in rioting and brothel-houses,
being ready to undertake anything for money, to the
hazzard of his life; when he heard of a rich matron of London,
that was troubled with a timpany, and was forsaken of
all physicians as past cure, he counterfeited himself to be a
physician in practice, giving forth that he would cure her
and all diseases. But as the custom is, he must have half in
hand, and the other half under her hand, to be payed when
she was cured. Then he gave her a Spider to drink, as
supposing her past cure, promising to make her well in
three dayes, and so in a coach with four horses he presently
hastes out of town, lest there being a rumor of the death of
her (which he supposed to be very neer) he should be apprehended
for killing her. But the woman shortly after by
the force of the venome was cured, and the ignorant physician,
who was the author of so great a work, was not known.
After some moneths this good man returns, not knowing what
had happened, and secretly enquiring concerning the state of
that woman, he heard she was recovered. Then he began
to boast openly, and to ask her how she had observed her
diet, and he excused his long absence, by reason of the sickenesse
of a principal friend, and that he was certain that no
harm could proceed from so healthful physick; also he asked
confidently for the rest of his reward, and to be given him
freely.”<a id="Marker_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="marker">1229</a></p>

<p>“A third kind of Spiders,” says Pliny, “also known as
the ‘phalangium,’ is a Spider with a hairy body, and a head
of enormous size. When opened, there are found in it two
small worms, they say: these, attached in a piece of deer’s
skin, before sunrise, to a woman’s body, will prevent conception,
according to what Cæcilius, in his Commentaries,
says. This property lasts, however, for a year only; and,
indeed, it is the only one of all the anti-conceptives that I
feel myself at liberty to mention, in favour of some women
whose fecundity, quite teeming with children (plena liberis),
stands in need of some such respite.”<a id="Marker_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="marker">1230</a></p>

<p>Mr. John Aubrey, in the chapter of his Miscellanies devoted
to Magick, gives the following: “To cure a Beast that
is sprung, (that is) poisoned (It mostly lights upon Sheep):
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_361" title="361"></a><!--362.png-->
Take the little red Spider, called a tentbob (not so big as a
great pin’s-head), the first you light upon in the spring of the
year, and rub it in the palm of your hand all to pieces: and
having so done, make water on it, and rub it in, and let it
dry; then come to the beast and make water in your hand,
and throw it in his mouth. It cures in a matter of an hour’s
time. This rubbing serves for a whole year, and it is no
danger to the hand. The chiefest skill is to know whether
the beast be poisoned or no.”<a id="Marker_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="marker">1231</a> Mr. Aubrey had this receipt
from Mr. Pacy.</p>

<p>In the year 1709, M. Bon, of Montpellier, communicated
to the Royal Academy of that city a discovery which he had
made of a new kind of silk, from the very fine threads with
which several species of Spiders (probably the <i>Aranea diadema</i>
and others closely allied to it) inclose their eggs; which
threads were found to be much stronger than those composing
the Spider’s web. They were easily separated, carded,
and spun, and then afforded a much finer thread than that of
the silk-worm, but, according to Reaumur, inferior to this
both in luster and strength. They were also found capable
of receiving all the different dyes with equal facility. M.
Bon carried his experiments so far as to obtain two or three
pairs of stockings and gloves of this silk, which were of an
elegant gray color, and were presented, as samples, to the
Academy. As the Spiders also were much more prolific,
and much more hardy than silk-worms, great expectations
were formed of benefit of the discovery. Reaumur accordingly
took up and prosecuted the inquiry with zeal.
He computed that 663,522 Spiders would scarcely furnish a
single pound of silk; and conceived that it would be impossible
to provide the necessarily immense numbers with flies,
their natural food. This obstacle, however, was soon removed,
by his finding that they would subsist very well upon
earth-worms chopped, and upon the soft ends or roots of
feathers. But a new obstacle arose from their unsocial propensities,
which proved insurmountable; for though at first
they seemed to feed quietly, and even work together, several
of them at the same web, yet they soon began to quarrel,
and the strongest devoured the weakest, so that of several
hundred, placed together in a box, but three or four remained
alive after a few days; and nobody could propose
to keep and feed each separately. The silk was found to be
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_362" title="362"></a><!--363.png-->
naturally of different colors; particularly white, yellow, gray,
sky-blue, and coffee-colored brown.<a id="Marker_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="marker">1232</a></p>

<p>A Spider raiser in France, more recently, is said to have
tamed eight hundred Spiders, which he kept in a single
apartment for their silk.<a id="Marker_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="marker">1233</a></p>

<p>De Azara states that in Paraguay a Spider forms a
spherical cocoon for its eggs, an inch in diameter, of a
yellow silk, which the inhabitants spin on account of the
permanency of the color.<a id="Marker_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="marker">1234</a></p>

<p>The ladies of Bermuda make use of the silk of the Silk-Spider,
<i>Epeira clavipes</i>, for sewing purposes.<a id="Marker_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="marker">1235</a></p>

<p>The Spider-web fabric has been carried so nearly to transparency
(in Hindostan) that the Emperor Aurengzebe is said
to have reproved his daughter for the indelicacy of her
costume, while she wore as many as seven thicknesses of it.<a id="Marker_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="marker">1236</a></p>

<p>Astronomers employ the strongest thread of Spiders, the
one, namely, that supports the web, for the divisions of the
micrometer. By its ductility this thread acquires about a
fifth of its ordinary length.<a id="Marker_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="marker">1237</a></p>

<p>Topsel, in his History of Four-footed Beasts and Serpents,
has the following, which he calls an “old and common
verse:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
Nos aper auditu præcellit, Aranea tactu,

<p>“It is manifest,” says Moufet, “that Spiders are bred of
some aereall seeds putrefied, from filth and corruption, because
that the newest houses the first day they are whited
will have both Spiders and cobwebs in them.”<a id="Marker_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="marker">1239</a> This theory
of generation from putrefaction was a favorite one among
the ancient writers; see the history of the Scorpion.</p>

<p>It may be new to many of our readers, who are familiar
with the Elegy in a Country Church-yard, to be told that its
author was at the pains to turn the characteristics of the
Linnæan orders of insects into Latin hexameters, the manuscript
of which is still preserved in his interleaved copy of
the “Systema Naturæ.”<a id="Marker_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="marker">1240</a></p>

<p>It is related by Boerhaave, in his Life of Swammerdam,
that when the Grand Duke of Tuscany was visiting with
Mr. Thevenot the curiosities of Holland, in 1668, he found
nothing more worthy of his admiration than the great naturalist’s
account of the structure of caterpillars,&mdash;for Swammerdam,
by the skillful management of instruments of wonderful
delicacy and fineness, showed the duke in what manner
the future butterfly, with all its parts, lies neatly folded
up in the caterpillar, like a rose in the unexpanded bud.
He was, indeed, so struck with this and other wonders of
the insect world, disclosed to him by the great naturalist,
that he made him the offer of twelve thousand florins to induce
him to reside at his court; but Swammerdam, from
feelings of independence, modestly declined to accept it,
preferring to continue his delightful studies at home.<a id="Marker_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="marker">1241</a></p>

<p>There is an epitaph in the church of St. Hilary at Poictiers,
beginning “Vermibus hic ponor,” which the people
interpreted to mean that a Saint was buried there who undertook
to cure children of the worms. Women, accordingly
used to scrape the tomb and administer the powder;
but the clergy, to prevent this absurdity (for Luther had
arisen), erected a barrier to keep them off. They soon began,
however, to carry away for the same purpose pieces of
the wooden bars.<a id="Marker_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="marker">1242</a></p>

<p>A diseased woman at Patton, drinking of the water in
which the bones of St. Milburge were washed, there came
from her stomach “a filthie worme, ugly and horrible to behold,
having six feete, two hornes on his head, and two on
his tayle.” Brother Porter, in his Flowers of the Saints,
tells this, and adds that the “worme was shutt up in a hollow
piece of wood, and reserved afterward in the monasterie
as a trophy and monument of S. Milburg, untill, by the
lascivious furie of him that destroyed all goodness in England,
that with other religious houses and monasteries, went
to ruin.” Hence the “filthie worme” was lost, and we have
nothing now instead but the Reformation.<a id="Marker_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="marker">1243</a></p>

<p>Capt. Clarke, in his passage from Dublin to Chester, on
the 2d of September, 1733, met with a cloud “of flying insects
of various sorts,” which stuck about the rigging of the
vessel in a surprising manner.<a id="Marker_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="marker">1244</a></p>

<p>De Geer, chamberlain to the King of Sweden, writes
(iv. 63) that in January, 1749, at Leufsta, in Sweden, and
in three or four neighboring parishes, the snow was covered
with living worms and insects of various kinds. The people
assured him they fell with the snow, and he was shown
several that had dropped on people’s hats. He caused the
snow to be removed from places where these worms had
been seen, and found several which seemed to be on the surface
of the snow which had fallen before, and were covered
by the succeeding. It was impossible that they could have
come there from under the ground, which was then frozen
more than three feet deep, and absolutely impervious to
such insects. In 1750, he again discovered vast quantities
of insects on the snow, which covered a large frozen lake
some leagues from Stockholm. Preceding and accompanying
both these falls of insects were violent storms that had
torn up trees by the roots, and carried away to a great distance
the surrounding earth, and at the same time the insects
which had taken up their winter quarters in it.<a id="Marker_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="marker">1245</a> These insects
were chiefly <i>Brachyptera</i> L., <i>Aphodii</i>, Spiders, caterpillars,
and particularly the larvæ of the <i>Telephorus fuscus</i>.<a id="Marker_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="marker">1246</a>
Another shower of insects is recorded to have fallen
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_365" title="365"></a><!--366.png-->
in Hungary, November 20, 1672;<a id="Marker_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="marker">1247</a> another, also, in the

<p>In the Muses Threnodie, p. 213, we read that “many are
the instances, even to this day, of charms practised among
the vulgar, especially among the Highlands, attended with
forms of prayer. In the Miscellaneous MS., written by
Baillie Dundee, among several medicinal receipts I find an
exorcism against all kinds of worms in the body, in the name
of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to be repeated three
mornings, as a certain remedy.”<a id="Marker_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="marker">1249</a></p>

<p>The Guahibo, Humboldt says, that “eats everything that

<p>“The seventeene of March, 1586,” says John Stow in his
Annales of England, “a strange thing happened, the like
whereof before hath not beene heard of in our time. Master
Dorington, of Spaldwicke, in the countie of Huntington,
esquier, one of his maiesties gentlemen Pensioners, had a
horse which died sodainly, and, being ripped to see the cause
of his death, there was found in the hole of the hart of the
same horse a strange worme, which lay on a round heape in
a kall or skin of the likeness of a toade, which, being taken
out and spread abroad, was in forme and fashion not easie to
be described, the length of which worme divided into many
greines to the number of fiftie (spread from the bodie like
the branches of a tree), was from the snowte to the ende of
the longest greine, seventeene inches, having four issues in
the greines, from the which dropped foorth a red water; the
body in bignes round about was three inches and a halfe,
the colour whereof was very like a makerel. This monstrous
worme, found in manner aforesaid, crauling to have got
away, was stabbed in with a dagger and died, which, after
being dried, was shewed to many honorable persons of the
realme.”<a id="Marker_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="marker">1252</a></p>

<p>Dr. Sparrman, in his journey to Paarl, an inland town
at the Cape of Good Hope, having filled his insect-box with
fine specimens, was obliged to put a “whole regiment of
flies and other insects” round the brim of his hat. Having
entered the house of a rich old widow troubled with the gout,
for food, he was warned by his servant that if she should
happen to see the insects he would certainly be turned out
of doors for a conjuror (hexmeester). Accordingly he was
very careful to keep his hat always turned away from her,
but all would not do&mdash;the old lady discovered the “little
beasts,” and to her greater astonishment that they were run
through their bodies with pins. An immediate explanation
was demanded; and had the doctor not been just then lamenting
with the widow for her deceased husband, and giving
dissertations on the dropsy and cough that carried off
the poor man, the explanation he gave would hardly have
been sufficient to quell the rage of this superstitious boor at
the thought of there being a sorcerer in her house.<a id="Marker_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="marker">1253</a></p>

<p>In several parts of Europe quite a trade is carried on
in the way of buying and selling rare insects, chiefly the
rare Alpine butterflies and moths. The instant the entomologist
steps from his carriage, in the celebrated valley of
Chamouni, with net in hand, whence he is known to be a
papillionist, he is surrounded by half a dozen Savoyard
boys, from the age of fifteen down to eight, each with a
large collecting-box full of insects in his hands for sale, and
with the scientist bargains for the insects that are found only
on the mountains, and which these hardy chaps alone can
obtain. There are again insect dealers on a larger scale,
who live there, and have many of these boys in their employ;
one of which wholesale merchants, Michel Bossonney, at
Martigni in the Vallais, in the year 1829, sold 7000 insects,
mostly of rare and beautiful species. Another dealer, on a
perhaps still larger scale, is M. Provost Duval, of Geneva,
a highly respectable entomologist. In 1830, he could supply
upwards of 600 species of Lepidoptera, and as many
Coleoptera, of the Swiss Alps, the south of France, and
Germany, at prices varying from one to fifteen francs each,
according to their rarity.</p>

<p>The advantage of this new traffic, both to the individuals
engaged in it and to science, is great. Now the <i>Sphinx
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_367" title="367"></a><!--368.png-->
(Deilephila) hippophaes</i>, formerly sold at sixty francs each,
and of which one of the first discovered specimens was sold
for two hundred francs, is so plentiful, in consequence of the
numbers collected and reared through their several stages, by
the peasants all along the course of the Arve, where the
plant, <i>Hippophae rhamöides</i>, on which the larvæ feed, and
the imago takes its specific name, grows in profusion, that a
specimen costs but three francs. A general taste also for the
science, and an appreciation for beauty, is spread by the more
striking Alpine species, such as <i>Parnassius apollo</i> and <i>Calichroma
alpina</i>, not only among the travelers who buy them
for their beauty, who before would hardly deign to look upon
an insect, but among the more ignorant Alpine collectors
themselves.<a id="Marker_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="marker">1254</a></p>

<p>Navarette, under the head of “Insects and Vermin,” speaks
of an animal which the Chinese call Jen Ting, or Wall-dragon,
because it runs up and down walls. It is also, says
this traveler, called the Guard of the Palace, and this for the
following reason: The emperors were accustomed to make
an ointment of this insect, and some other ingredients, with
which they anointed their concubines’ wrists, as the mark of
it continued as long as they had not to do with man; but
as soon as they did so, it immediately vanished, by which
their honesty or falsehood was discovered. Hence it came
that this insect was called the Guard of the Court, or, of the
court ladies. Navarette laments that all men have not a
knowledge of this wonderful ointment.<a id="Marker_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="marker">1255</a></p>

<p>Navarette tells us he once caught (in China?) a small insect
that was injurious to poultry&mdash;“a very deformed insect,
and of a strange shape”&mdash;when, as soon as it was known,
several women ran to him to beg its <i>tail</i>. He gave it to
them, and they told him it was of excellent use when dried,
and made into powder, “being a prodigious help to women
in labor, to forward their delivery, if they drank it in a little
wine.”<a id="Marker_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="marker">1256</a></p>

<p>The Irish have a large beetle of which strange tales are

<p>Turpin, in his History of Siam, says: “There is a very
singular animal in Siam … bred in the dung of elephants.
It is entirely black, its wings are strong, and its
head extremely curious: it is furnished on the top with
several points, in the form of a trunk, and a small horn in
the middle: it has four large feet, which raise it more than
an inch from the ground: its back seems to be one very
hard entire shell. It flies to the very top of the cocoa-trees,
of which it eats the heart, and often kills them, if a remedy
is not applied. Children play with them, and make them
fight.”<a id="Marker_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="marker">1258</a></p>

<p>General Count Déjeau, Aid-de-camp to Napoleon Bonaparte,
was so anxious, says Jaeger, in his Life of North
American Insects, to increase the number of specimens in
his entomological cabinet, that he even availed himself of
his military campaigns for this purpose, and was continually
occupied in collecting insects and fastening them with pins
on the outside of his hat, which was always covered with
them. The Emperor, as well as the whole army, were accustomed
to see General Déjeau’s head thus singularly ornamented,
even when in battle. But the departed spirits of
those murdered insects once had their revenge on him; for,
in the battle of Wagram, in 1809, and while he was at the
side of Napoleon, a shot from the enemy struck Déjeau’s
head, and precipitated him senseless from his horse. Soon,
however, recovering from the shock, and being asked by the
Emperor if he was still alive, he answered, “I am not dead;
but, alas! my insects are all gone!” for his hat was literally
torn to pieces.<a id="Marker_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="marker">1259</a></p>

<p>Professor Jaeger tells also the following anecdote of
another passionate naturalist: The celebrated Prince Paul
of Würtemberg, whom Mr. Jaeger met in 1829 at Port-au-Prince,
being one day at the latter’s house, shed tears of
envy when he showed him the gigantic beetle Actæon,
which, only a short time before, had been presented to him
by the Haytien Admiral Banajotti, he having found it at the
foot of a cocoa-nut tree on his plantation.<a id="Marker_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="marker">1260</a></p>

<p>While traveling in Poland, Professor Jaeger visited the
highly accomplished Countess Ragowska, at her country
residence, when she exhibited her fine, scientifically-arranged
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_369" title="369"></a><!--370.png-->
collection of butterflies and other insects, and told him that
she had personally instructed her children in botany, history,
and geography by means of her entomological cabinet&mdash;botany,
from the plants on which the various larvæ feed;
history, from the names, as Menelaus, Berenice, etc., given
as specific names to the perfect insects; and geography, from
the native countries of the several specimens.<a id="Marker_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="marker">1261</a> From the
scientific names of insects, and the technical terms employed
in their study, quite a knowledge of Latin and Greek, and
philology in general, might also be gained.</p>

<p>In R. Brookes’ “Natural History of Insects, with their
properties and uses in medicine,” we find the following
statement: “There have been the solid shells of a sort of
Beetle brought to England, that were found on the eastern
coast of Africa, over against part of the Island of Madagascar,
which the natives hang to their necks, and make use
of them as whistles to call their cattle together.”<a id="Marker_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="marker">1262</a> What this
“sort of Beetle” is I have not been able yet to determine.</p>

<p>Mr. Fitch W. Taylor, chaplain to the squadron commanded
by Commodore Geo. C. Read, gives a translation
of several Siamese books, and among others the Siamese
Dream-book. It was translated by Mrs. Davenport, and the
subject is thus introduced:</p>

<p>“In former times a great prophet and magician, who had
much wisdom and could foretell all future events, gave the
following interpretation of signs and dreams. Whosoever
sees signs and visions, if he wishes to know whether they
forebode good or evil, whether happiness or misery, if he
dream of any animals, insects, birds, or fishes, and wishes
to know the interpretation, let him examine this book.”</p>

<p>Of these signs and dreams I make extract of those which
refer to insects, as follows:</p>

<p>“If a person be alone, and an insect or reptile fall before
the face, but the individual see it only without touching it,
it denotes that some heavenly being will bestow great
blessings on him. If it fall to the right side, it denotes that
all his friends, wherever scattered abroad, shall again meet
him in peace. If it fall behind the person, it denotes that
he shall be slandered and maliciously talked of by his friends
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_370" title="370"></a><!--371.png-->
and acquaintances. If in falling it strike the face, it denotes
that the individual will soon be married. If it strike
the right arm, it denotes that the individual’s wishes, whatever
they are, shall be accomplished. If it strike the left
hand, it denotes that the individual will lose his friends
by death. If it strike the foot, it denotes that whatever
trouble the individual may have had, all shall vanish, and he
shall reach the summit of happiness. If, after touching the
foot, it should crawl upward toward the head, it denotes
that the individual shall be raised to high office by the rulers
of his country. If it crawl to the right side, it denotes
that the person shall hear bad tidings of some absent friend.
If the insect or reptile fall without touching the body, and
immediately flee toward the northeast, it denotes deep but
not lasting trouble; if toward the northwest, it denotes
that the person shall receive numerous and valuable presents;
if toward the southeast, it denotes that he shall receive
great riches, and afterwards go to a distant land; or
that he shall go to a distant land, and there amass great
wealth.</p>

<p>“If an animal, insect, bird, or reptile, cross the path of
any one as he walks along, the animal coming from the
right, let him not proceed&mdash;some calamity will surely happen
to him in the way. If the animal come from the left,
let him proceed&mdash;good fortune shall surely happen to him.
If the animal proceed before him in the same road in which
he intends to travel, it denotes good fortune.…</p>

<p>“I now beg to interpret the signs of the night. If at
midnight an individual hears the noises of animals in the
house where he resides, I will show him whether they indicate
good or evil. If any insect cry ‘click, click, click,’ he
will possess real treasures while he abides there. If it cry
‘kek, kek,’ it is an evil omen both to that and the neighboring
houses. If it cry ‘chit, chit,’ it denotes that he shall
always feed upon the most sumptuous provisions. If it cry
‘keat, keat,’ in a loud, shrill voice, it denotes that his residence
there shall be attended with evil.</p>

<p>“I now beg to interpret with regard to the Spider. If a
Spider on the ceiling utter a low, tremulous moan, it denotes
that the individual who hears the noise shall either change
his residence or that his goods shall be stolen. If it utter
the same voice on the outside of the house, and afterward
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_371" title="371"></a><!--372.png-->
the Spider crawl to the head of the bed, it denotes troublesome
visitors and quarrels to the residents.”<a id="Marker_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="marker">1263</a></p>

<p>Thevenot, in his Travels into the Levant, relates the following:
“But I cannot tell what to say of a Moorish Woman
who lives in a corner close by the quarter of France,
and pulls worms out of Children’s Ears. When a Child does
nothing but cry, and that they know it is ill, they carry it
to that Woman, who, laying the Child on its side upon her
knee, scratches the ear of it, and then Worms, like those
which breed in musty weevily Flower, seem to fall out of
the Child’s Ear; then, turning it on the other side, she
scratches the other Ear, out of which the like Worms drop
also; and in all there may come out ten or twelve, which
she raps up in a Linen-Rag, and gives them to those that
brought the Child to her, who keep them in that Rag at
home in their House; and when she has done so she gives
them back the Child, which in reality cries no more. She
once told me that she performed this by means of some
words that she spake. There was a French Physician and
a Naturalist there, who attentively beheld this, and told me
that he could not conceive how it could be done; but that
he knew very well that if a child had any of these Worms
in its head it would quickly die. In so much that the
Moors and other inhabitants of <i>Caire</i> look upon this as a
great Vertue, and give her every time a great many <i>maidins</i>
(pieces of money). They say that it is a secret which hath
been long in the Family. There are children every day carried
to her, roaring and crying, and as many would see the
thing done, need only to follow them, provided they be not
Musulman Women who carry them, for then it would cost
an <i>Avanie;</i> but when they are Christian or Jewish Women,
one may easily enter and give a few <i>maidins</i> to that Worm-drawer.”<a id="Marker_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="marker">1264</a></p>

<p>This is most probably but a sleight-of-hand performance,
since “worms, like those which breed in musty weevily
flower,” could easily be obtained and concealed in her hand
or sleeve; imagination would then effect the cure, as probably
it had done the disease.</p>

<p>Dr. Livingstone and his party, in traveling in South Africa,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_372" title="372"></a><!--373.png-->
sometimes suffered considerably from scarcity of meat,
though not from absolute want of food. And the natives,
says this traveler, to show their sympathy, gave the children,
who suffered most, a large kind of caterpillar, which they
seemed to relish. He concluded these insects could not be
unwholesome, for the natives devoured them in large quantities
themselves.<a id="Marker_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="marker">1265</a></p>

Beetill they (the Egyptians) reverence, because they observe in
them I wot not what little slender Images (like as in drops of water
we see the resemblance of the Sun) of the Divine power.…
As for the Beetills, they hold, that throughout all their kinds there
is no female, but all the males do blow or cast their seed into a
certain globus or round matter in the form of balls, which they
drive from them and roll to and fro contrariwise, like as the Sun,
when he moveth himself from the West to the East, seemeth to turn
about the Heaven clean contrary.”&mdash;p. 1071, ed. of 1657.</p>

There is now at Thebes an arch-forger of Scarabæi&mdash;a certain
Ali Gamooni, whose endeavors, in the manufacture of these much-sought-after
relics, have been crowned with the greatest success.
For the coarser description of these, he has, as well as chance European
purchasers, an outlet in a native market; for they are bought
from him to be carried up the river into Nubia, where they are
favorite amulets and ornaments, as mothers greatly delight to patch
one or two to the girdles by short thongs, which constitute the only
article of dress of their children. Through this very medium, too,
it sometimes happens that these spurious Scarabæi come into the
possession of unsophisticated travelers, who are not likely to suspect
their origin in that remote country, and under such circumstances.</p>

<p>Scarabæi also of the more elegant and well-finished descriptions
are not beyond the range of this curious counterfeiter. These
he makes of the same material as the ancients themselves used,&mdash;a
close-grained, easily-cut limestone, which, after it is graven into
shape and lettered, receives a greenish glaze by being baked on a
shovel with brass filings.</p>

<p>Ali, not content with closely imitating, has even aspired to the
creative; so antiquarians must be on their guard lest they waste
their time and learning on antiquities of a very modern date.&mdash;<i>Vide</i>
Rhind’s Thebes, p. 253&ndash;5. Mr. Gliddon, in an incidental
note, <cite>Indig. Races</cite>, p. 192, takes credit for having furnished this
same Ali, some twenty-four years ago (as it would appear), with
broken penknives and other appliances to aid his already-manifested
talent, in the somewhat fantastic hope of flooding the local market
with such curiosities, and so saving the monuments from being laid
under contribution!</p>

Of those deposited in the British Museum, Mr. Birch has made
the following report:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A Scarabæus having on the base <i>Ra-men-Chepr</i>, a prenomen of
Thothmes III. Beneath is a Scarab between two feathers, placed
on the basket <i>sub.</i></p></li>

<li><p>A Scarabæus in dark steaschist, with the figure of the sphinx
(the sun), and an emblem between the fore paws of the monster.
The sphinx constantly appears on the Scarabæi of Thothmes III.,
and it is probably to this monarch that the one here described belongs.
(On many Scarabæi in the British Museum, and on those
figured by Klaproth from the Palin Collection, in Leeman’s Monuments,
and in the “Description de l’Egypt,” Thothmes is represented
as a sphinx treading foreign prisoners under him.&mdash;<i>Layard.</i>)
After the Sphinx on this Scarab are the titles of the king, “The
sun-placer of creation,” of Thothmes III.</p></li>

<li><p>Small Scarabæus of white steaschist, with a brownish hue;
reads <i>Neter nefer nebta Ra-neb-ma</i>, “The good God, the Lord of the
Earth, the Sun, the Lord of truth, rising in all lands.” This is
Amenophis III., one of the last kings of the <span class="smaller">XVIII.</span> dynasty, who
flourished about the fifteenth century <span class="smaller">B.C.</span></p></li>

<li><p>Scarabæus in white steaschist, with an abridged form of the
prenomen of Thothmes III., <i>Ra-men-cheper at en Amen</i>, “The sun-placer
of creation, the type of Ammon.” This monarch was the
greatest monarch of the <span class="smaller">XVIII.</span> dynasty, and conquered Naharaina
and the Saenkar, besides receiving tribute from Babel or Babylon
and Assyria.</p></li>

<li><p>Scarabæus in pale white steaschist, with three emblems that
cannot well be explained. They are the sun’s disk, the ostrich
feather, the uræus, and the guitar nablium. They may mean
“Truth the good goddess,” or “lady,” or <i>ma-nefer</i>, “good and
true.”</p></li>

<li><p>Scarabæus in the same substance, with a motto of doubtful
meaning.</p></li>

<li><p>Scarabæus, with a hawk, and God holding the emblem of life,
and the words <i>ma nefer</i>, “good and true.” The meaning very
doubtful.</p></li>

<li><p>A Scarabæus with a hawk-headed gryphon, emblem of <i>Menta-Ra</i>,
or Mars. Behind the monster is the goddess Sati, or Nuben.
The hawk-headed lion is one of the shapes into which the sun turns
himself in the hours of the day. It is a common emblem of the
Aramæan religion.</p></li>

<li><p>Scarabæus with hawk-headed gryphon, having before in the
uræus and the <i>nabla</i> or guitar, hieroglyphic of good. Above it are
the hieroglyphics “Lord of the earth.”</p></li>

<li><p>Small Scarabæus in dark steaschist, with a man in adoration
to a king or deity, wearing a crown of the upper country, and
holding in the left hand a lotus flower. Between this is the emblem
of life.</p></li>

<li><p>Scarabæus, with the hawk-headed Scarabæus, emblem of
<i>Ra-cheper</i>, “the creator Sun,” flying with expanded wings, four in
number, which do not appear in Egyptian mythology till after the
time of the Persians, when the gods assume a more Pantheistic
form. Such a representation of the sun, for instance, is found in
the Torso Borghese.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It will be observed, adds Layard, that most of the Egyptian relics
discovered in the Assyrian ruins are of the time of the <span class="smaller">XVIII.</span> Egyptian
dynasty, or of the fifteenth century before Christ; a period
when, as we learn from Egyptian monuments, there was a close
connection between Assyria and Egypt.&mdash;Layard’s <cite>Babylon and
Nineveh</cite>, p. 239&ndash;240.</p>

<cite>Phil. Trans. Abridg.</cite>, ix. 11. Concerning the worship of animals
in general by the Egyptians, the following remarks in a note may not
be inappropriate, as they embrace the worship of the Scarabæus.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A class of animals, to which may be referred the cow, dog,
sheep, and ibis, were <em>at first</em> naturally protected and respected out
of gratitude for the benefits derived from them. But in time, it is
supposed, this respect, by unthoughtful descendants believing too
implicitly the teachings of their fathers, was gradually enlarged to
so great extent that it became reverence, and at last, perhaps after
centuries, worship. For example, at A time, the ibis is respected
on account of its destroying noxious serpents; at B, reverenced;
and at C, worshiped.</p></li>

<li><p>When at C time, the ibis is worshiped, suppose the masses have
lost the reason (which in the case of the Egyptians is an allowable
supposition, since it is an historical fact that but the initiated knew
the reasons for their manner of worship), and serpents are its food, is
it not plain then that if the food be taken away the sacred bird cannot
live? Hence at C time are serpents preserved and protected as food
for the ibis; and as this protecting care increases as above, till at D
they are reverenced, and at E worshiped. To this second class may
be referred the crocodile, which was preserved, etc. as food for the
ichneumon, a sacred animal of the first class.</p></li>

<li><p>Analogies between animals, and even plants, and certain sources
of goodness, or objects of wonder, as the sun, and motion of the
stars, were at A time, noticed; at B, respected or reverenced; and
at C, worshiped. Thus, among plants, became the onion sacred, from
the resemblance of the laminæ which compose it, in a transverse
section, to circles&mdash;to the orbits of the planets. And thus the Scarabæus
from the analogies between its movements and shape and the
motions of the sun, traced, as we have before remarked on the authority
of several ancient writers, became also an object of adoration.</p></li>

<li><p>A fourth reason may also be given, which follows as a consequence
of the latter. If such analogy, as, for example, that between
the beetle and the sun, had been observed in the time of picture and
hieroglyphic writing, to represent the sun, the beetle would have
been taken. Now, it is a well-authenticated fact, that these hieroglyphics
in time became sacred, and, if the beetle was found among
them, it for this, if for no other reason, would have been looked upon
with the same veneration.</p></li>

<li><p>Good men, too, to preserve the lives of animals oftentimes wantonly
taken, introduce them into fables and poetry, and connect
pleasing tales with them. The “Babes in the Wood” have so fixed
the respect for the tameness of the robin, that it is even now deemed
a sacrilege with our boys to stone this bird. And may there not
have been such good men, and such tender stories, among the Egyptians,
and the remembrance of whom and which long lost by the
lapse of time?</p></li>

Brookes informs us that Dr. Greenfield, a practitioner in London,
was sent to Newgate, by the college, for having given Cantharides
inwardly. This happened in the year 1698; but he was
soon after released, by a superior authority, when he published a
work upon the good effects of these insects taken inwardly for
strangury, and other disorders of the kidneys and bladder. We
are also told by Ambrose Parry, that a courtezan, having invited a
young man to supper, had seasoned some of the dishes with the
powder of Cantharides, which the very next day produced such an
effect, that he died with an evacuation of blood, which the physicians
were not able to stop. Many other instances might be
brought, continues Brookes, of persons that have been either
killed, or brought to death’s door, by a wanton use of these Flies,
which had been given them privately, with a design to cause love.
Some go so far as to affirm, that people have been thrown into a
fever, only by sleeping under trees on which were a great number
of Cantharides; and Mr. Boyle informs us, after authors worthy of
credit, that some persons have felt considerable pains about the
neck of the bladder, only by holding Cantharides in their hands.&mdash;<cite>Nat.

Bochart, <cite>Hierozoic</cite>, Pt. II. L. iv. c. 5, 475.&mdash;Much of this description
is quite oriental, but such is the general resemblance to some of
the animals mentioned, that in Italy it still bears the name of “Cavalletta.”
A German name for this Locust, as well as the Grasshopper
(before mentioned), is the “Hay-horse.” About the Locust’s neck,
too, the integuments have some resemblance to the trappings of a
horse; some species, however, have the appearance of being hooded.
In the Bible, Locusts are compared to horses.&mdash;Joel, ii. 4; Rev. ix. 7.
Ray says, “<i>Caput oblongum, equi instar prona spectans</i>.”</p>

Peter Rotharmel had three specialties: Bees, Wheat, and Bonaparte.
Concerning Bees, he had many strange notions, but the
above recorded is the only one of which I have any positive information.
Concerning wheat, at one time in his life he purchased
an almanac, which indicated, among other things, the high and low
tides, and, from studying this, he got it into his head that the fluctuations
in the price of wheat were intimately connected with the rise
and fall of the tides. So impressed was he with this idea, that he
ever afterward yearly bought that particular almanac, and prophesied
from it to his neighbors the probable value of their coming
crops of wheat. On Sunday, he would walk fifteen and twenty
miles through the country, to examine the different wheat-fields,
and to afford him a topic of conversation for the ensuing week.
But Napoleon was his principal study and his greatest mania. On
him he would talk for hours, on the slightest provocation. The
history of Bonaparte and his campaigns, which he only read, was
an old German one.</p>

The origin of red snow has likewise been a puzzle and query for
ages, and many theories have been advanced by philosophers and
naturalists to account for it. To those interested in the solution of
this phenomenon, the following extract from the <cite>Mag. of Nat. Hist.</cite>,
vol. ii. p. 322, may be curious, if not satisfactory. Mr. Thomas
Nicholson, accompanied with two other gentlemen, made an excursion
the 24th July, 1821, to Sowallick Point, near Bushman’s
Island, in Prince Regent’s Bay, in quest of meteoric iron. “The
summit of the hill,” he says, “forming the point, is covered with
huge masses of granite, whilst the side, which forms a gentle declivity
to the bay, was covered with crimson snow. It was evident,
at first view, that this colour was imparted to the snow by a substance
lying on the surface. This substance lay scattered here and
there in small masses, bearing some resemblance to powdered cochineal,
surrounded by a lighter shade, which was produced by the
colouring matter being partly dissolved and diffused by the deliquescent
snow. During this examination our hats and upper garments
were observed to be daubed with a substance of a similar
red colour, and a moment’s reflection convinced us that this was the
excrement of the little Auk (<i>Uria alle</i>, Temmink), myriads of which
were continually flying over our heads, having their nests among
the loose masses of granite. A ready explanation of the origin of
the red snow was now presented to us, and not a doubt remained in
the mind of any that this was the correct one. The snow on the
mountains of higher elevation than the nests of these birds was
perfectly white, and a ravine at a short distance, which was filled
with snow from top to bottom, but which afforded no hiding-place
for these birds to form their nests, presented an appearance uniformly
white.”
</p>
<p>
This testimony seems to be as clear and indisputable as the explanation
given by Peiresc of the ejecta of the Butterflies at Aix.
But though it will account, perhaps, for the red snow of the polar
regions, it will not explain that of the Alps, the Apennines, and
the Pyrenees, which are not, so far as is known, visited by the little
Auk.&mdash;Vide <cite>Ins. Transf.</cite>, p. 352&ndash;5.</p>

unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine
hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers,
and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they
may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the
land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.

<p>
“20. And Moses and Aaron did so, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded; and
he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river in
the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the
waters that were in the river were turned to blood.”</p>

Reaumur considers this cry to be produced by the friction of the
palpi against the proboscis (<cite>Memoires</cite>, ii. 293). Huber, but without
mentioning the particulars, says he has ascertained that Reaumur
was quite mistaken (<cite>On Bees</cite>, p. 313, note). Schroeter ascribes the
sound to the rubbing of the tongue against the head; and Rösel to
the friction of the chest upon the abdomen. M. de Johet thinks it
is produced by the air being suddenly propelled against these scales
by the action of the wings. M. Lorry states that the sound arises
from the air escaping rapidly through peculiar cavities communicating
with the spiracles, and furnished with a fine tuft of hairs on the
sides of the abdomen (Cuv. <cite>An. Kingd.&mdash;Ins.</cite>, ii. 678). Mr. E.&nbsp;L.
Layard seems to be of the same opinion (Tennent’s <cite>Nat. Hist. of
Ceylon</cite>, p. 427). But M. Passerini, curator of the Museum of Nat.
Hist. at Florence, has lately investigated the subject more minutely.
He traced the origin of the sound to the interior of the head, in
which he discovered a cavity at the passage where muscles are placed
for impelling and expelling the air. M. Dumeril has since discovered
a sort of membrane stretched over this cavity, like, as he says, to the
head of a drum. M. Duponchel has also confirmed by experiment
the opinions of Passerini and Dumeril, and confutes Lorry, whose
notion was generally adopted, by stating that the noise is produced
from the head when the body of the insect is removed (<cite>Annales des
Sci. Nat.</cite>, Mars., 1828).</p>

<i>Georg.</i> iii. 328. Cf. Bucol. ii. Sir J.&nbsp;E. Smith, Tour., iii. 95,
says also that the common Italian species makes a most disagreeable
and dull chirping. The Cicadas of Africa, it is said, may be heard
half a mile off; and the sound of one in a room will put a whole
company to silence. Thunberg asserts that those of Java utter a
sound as shrill and piercing as that of a trumpet. Captain Hancock
informed Messrs. Kirby and Spence that the Brazilian Cicadas sing
as loud as to be heard at the distance of a mile. <cite>Introd.</cite>, ii. 400.
The sound of our American species, <i>C. septemdecim</i>, has been compared
to the ringing of horse-bells. The tettix of the Greeks, says
Dr. Shaw, <cite>Travels</cite>, 2d edit., p. 186, must have had quite a different
voice, more soft surely and more melodious; otherwise the fine
orators of Homer, who are compared to it, can be looked upon as
no better than loud, loquacious scolds.</p>

Hence the English word <i>Bug-bear</i>. In Matthew’s Bible, the passage
of the Psalms (xci. 5), “Thou shalt not be afraid of <em>the terror</em>
by night,” is rendered, “Thou shalt not nede to be afraid of any <em>bugs</em>
by night.” <em>Bug</em> in this sense often occurs in Shakspeare. <cite>Winter’s

Holl. <i>Trans.</i>, p. 76. There was one time a law at Athens, which
a good deal nonplussed these sponging gentlemen so appropriately
called Flies. “It was decreed that not more than thirty persons
should meet at a marriage feast; and a wealthy citizen, desirous of
going as far as the law would allow him, had invited the full complement.
An honest Fly, however, who respected no law that interfered
with his stomach; contrived to introduce himself, and took
his station at the lower end of the table. Presently the magistrate
appointed for the purpose entered, and espying his man at a glance,
began counting the guests, commencing on the other side and ending
with the parasite. ‘Friend,’ said he, ‘you must retire. I find
there is one more than the law allows.’ ‘It is quite a mistake, sir,’
replied the Fly, ‘as you will find if you will have the goodness to
count again, beginning <em>on this side</em>.’”&mdash;St. John’s <cite>Man. and Cust. of

this unfortunate prisoner had found a solace in the society of a
Spider, paid Pelisson a visit, desiring to see the manœuvres of the
insect. The Basque struck up his notes, the Spider instantly came
to be fed by his friend; but the moment it appeared on the floor of
the cell, the governor placed his foot on its body, and crushed it to
death.”</p>

This passage from Pliny is thus translated by Bostock and
Riley: “Presages are also drawn from the Spider, for when a river
is about to swell, it will suspend its web higher than usual. In
calm weather these insects do not spin, but when it is cloudy they
do, and hence it is, that a great number of cobwebs is a sure sign
of showery weather.”&mdash;<cite>Nat. Hist.</cite>, xi. 24 (28). <i>Trans.</i>, iii. 28.</p>

Pliny says the Spider, poised in its web, will throw itself upon
the head of a serpent as it lies stretched beneath the shade of the
tree where it has built, and with its bite pierce its brain; such is the
shock, he continues, that the creature will hiss from time to time,
and then, seized with vertigo, coil round and round, while it finds
itself unable to take to flight, or so much as to break the web of the
Spider, as it hangs suspended above; this scene, he concludes, only
ends with its death.&mdash;<cite>Nat. Hist.</cite>, x. 95.</p>
